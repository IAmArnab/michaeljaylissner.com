<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I’ve been working the past couple of days on getting my other site, 
charityhikers.org moved over to my home server and recreated on Drupal. It’s 
turning out to be a huge pain in the neck. The main problem is that there seem 
to be too many viable ways to accomplish what I want, and no consensus as to 
what the best one is. The result of this is that there are a number of 
half-hearted attempts at explaining how to have multiple sites running off of 
one Drupal installation, but none of them are really that detailed, or really 
apply all that well…it’s frustrating.</p>
<p>However! In doing this, I discovered a treasure I thought I had lost. I 
discovered my old <span class="caps">PCT</span> journal entries, which I have posted below, by date. 
It’s a bit long, so I won’t be offended if nobody reads them, but it’s 
interesting to see what I was thinking before the big trip back in ‘05. 
Unfortunately, I don’t have any of the actual posts from the trail, so it’s a 
bit of a cliff hanger. Alas.</p>
<h2 id="madman-planning">Madman Planning</h2>
<p><strong>21 March 2005</strong><br/>
Well, it seems the journaling function of my site is finally up and running.
It has been a long road to get here today, and I am glad we are finally 
nearing the end of it.</p>
<p>I can not say I have really kept a journal very much in the past, so this is a 
bit of a foreign medium to me. I write lots of personal emails though, so 
perhaps I will just pretend I am writing one of my confidants, and see how 
that goes for a while. Nah. Too easy.</p>
<p>So, planning for the trip comes along nicely these days. At this point, I am 
pretty much ready to go with the following enormous gaping holes in my preparations:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have not finalized my resupply bounce box, or the destinations it will be 
going to.</li>
<li>My first aid training from October is growing more and more useless by the 
day. I need to restudy it before the trip, but it is just so boring.</li>
<li>I need to move out.</li>
<li>Some sewing remains to be done.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess this means the planning is coming along nicely. Whatever the case, I 
will be ready when the time comes. I know what gear to take, and I have my 
many permits all taped to my wall.</p>
<p>Last weekend I took some time to actually study my first aid stuff. I 
discovered that I had indeed forgotten the many nuances of it as I had 
imagined I would. I did think of a brilliant way to remember it all though: I 
finally made my own <a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/SOAPA_Note.xls"><span class="caps">SOAP</span> note</a>. These are the things you use when an 
accident occurs to make sure you take all the right vital signs and ask all the 
right questions. By making my own, I essentially wrote myself a guide to first aid.</p>
<p>Jeesh this is a boring entry. I kind of just wanted to write it so that 
something would be here, and so people had something to read. I will write 
another one in a week or so.</p>
<h2 id="backpacking-journaling-etc">Backpacking, Journaling, Etc</h2>
<p><strong>25 March 2005</strong><br/>
Well, I think I said in the last journal entry that the journal site was done. 
That was a lie. It needs more work, and seems to be an interminable source of 
work. That having been said, I am fairly certain it is about done now. I have 
been working with a volunteer from Craig’s List on getting everything to work 
the way I want it to, and the result has been pretty sweet thus far. Last 
night I stayed up rather late and got it to its present condition. A number of 
changes have been made to it, but nothing that will wow non-coders, so I am 
going to spare you all any more talk about this subject.</p>
<p>A more interesting subject to talk about is the fact that I am going 
backpacking this weekend. It will probably be the last trip before the big one,
so it is a bit stressful. I am trying out a couple of new things, namely some 
padding that I put into the straps of the M5 so it would hold more weight, some 
new shoes that I pro-dealed from Vasque, and I think that is about it. I might 
see if I can stand using Ken (my quilt). It is getting warmer out.</p>
<p>The one thing that I haven not been able to decide is where the hell I want to 
go. I do not want to go to Big Sur because it is infested with Poison Oak and 
ticks, the trails are unreliable, and there is not that much ground to cover. 
So, that having been said, where should I go? Certainly not Point Reyes. Jesus 
that place is busy on a normal weekend, this is Easter weekend. I guess I 
could go to a more southern area in Los Padres forest and successfully dodge 
the snow down there. It is a long drive though. Much longer than I would like.</p>
<p>Anyway, as the last hike before the trip, it is bound to be humbling. I think 
I can get at least 50 miles in this weekend, so that will be good experience 
as well.</p>
<h2 id="skyline-to-sea-trip-report-raccoons-rains-and-rushing-waters">Skyline to Sea Trip Report » Raccoons, Rains, and Rushing Waters</h2>
<p><strong>28 March 2005</strong><br/>
Well, I am back from the trip, and it was quite awesome. Certainly something 
to write home about anyway.</p>
<p>I started off the trip on Saturday, whereupon I learned that there was no 
legal parking at the trail head. Pretty damned annoying really. I get out of 
bed early to rush myself to the trailhead, where I learn that there is no 
parking. There is not even a ranger station, but there is a payphone to make 
up for the lack of cell phone coverage. So, I called the station, and made 
reservations for the campsites. Do you take credit cards? Naturally, they do 
not, and naturally the nearest <span class="caps">ATM</span> is about half an hour away. So, here I am, 
I have my reservations, but no way to pay for them, and I am at the trailhead, 
with nowhere to park within about ten miles. I spend about half an hour looking 
for parking, eventually finding a place I can pull off the road that does not 
have any <em>blatant</em> signs saying I can’t park there. I park. I hit the trail, 
and for the first 2/3rds of Saturday, I followed the road, crossing it every 
few miles. It was noisy, and lame, but eventually it kind of veered away from 
the road and became much more beautiful. By the time I finished my first 16 
miles, and made camp, I was in the heart of the Big Basin Natural Park, a 
beautiful place indeed.</p>
<p>Upon waking up the next day, I headed west yet again, towards the sea. Beauty 
was everywhere, but it was the best when I saw the beginnings of Barney Falls, 
which are by far the most beautiful waterfalls I have ever seen outside of 
Yosemite. Imagine if you will, hiking along through trees that have been around 
since the Byzantine Empire (probably), on this verdant and moist trail. It is 
gorgeous. Then, all of a sudden, you see a waterfall that is about 50 feet 
high, and rather wide in the middle of it all — Gorgeous.</p>
<p>So, anyway, I eventually, made it to the sea, and turned around to head 31 
miles back to camp, and eventually my car. Along that direction, I saw a lot 
of the people that I had passed going the other way, and they were rather 
curious to see me coming at them a second time, but that is another story. The 
real story is that Rain was predicted. I made camp at Sunset Camp in what 
looked like a good spot if it should start raining. Well, it did start 
raining, and eventually that spot became flooded. I spent about an hour 
digging in the mud, making dikes and dams around my tarp, but in the end it 
proved to be a futile effort. I probably dumped out my 1L pot about 50 times 
before I gave up. It was a sad day, but luckily, moving my tarp was not such a 
big deal, so I did.</p>
<p>Night fell.</p>
<p>With night came animals (the bastards). I was sleeping under my tarp in one 
hell of a rain storm. Thus I could hear just about nothing. I woke up to see 
what looked like something white moving away from my tent. It was a full moon, 
but the clouds made it pitch dark out. I grabbed for my flashlight, and 
discovered that it was missing. Shit. I grabbed for my pack, where I had a 
backup light, and discovered <span class="caps">IT</span> was missing. <span class="caps">SHIT</span>. <span class="caps">SHIT</span>. <span class="caps">SHIT</span>. Bobcats have 
stolen my pack right from next to me under my tarp. I now have no light, and 
it is too dark to walk anywhere. Ok. I need to get a light from the people in 
the neighboring camp. They are asleep. I will have to wake them. Done. Ok. I 
have a light. It went on like that for about half an hour, eventually resulting 
in my discovery of everything that was once mine with the exception of my food 
bag, the food that was in it, and one of my (expensive titanium) stakes that 
had gone missing during the tent move. I tied my pack to my tarp with the 
theory being that if bobcats were going to steal my pack, they would have to 
wake me up to do it. They did come back to steal my <span class="caps">EMPTY</span> pack, but it is not 
like it woke me, and they were unable to get it untied. Oh, and they were 
apparently raccoons, not bobcats. So, in conclusion, I lost all of my food for 
the final day, and my pack got some tears in it. Not cool at all. So, I hiked 
out to the nearest road, informed the ranger, and hitch-hiked back to my car. 
All in all, about fifty miles covered, one storm bested, and a mafia of 
racoons fed.</p>
<h2 id="training-preparations-and-having-both-arms-pulled-in-opposite-directions">Training, Preparations and Having Both Arms Pulled In Opposite Directions</h2>
<p><strong>4 April 2005</strong><br/>
So, the final weeks are upon us. There’s no denying that now. How am I coping 
is probably the best question to ask at this point. The answer is that I’m 
losing a fair amount of sleep because I keep waking up with revelations pretty 
much every night, but other than that, I’m doing ok. Plus, I’m unemployed, so 
it doesn’t particularly matter that I don’t get the best sleep during the night 
because I can always just sleep more during the day.</p>
<p>These revelations though, they’ve got to stop. Pretty much every night I 
either dream <span class="caps">PCT</span>, or wake up around four in the morning with the revelation 
that, “Put shampoo in your bounce box,” or, “you’ll want a 
phone card.” Really, I wish my brain would just take a chill pill. Last 
night was especially bad, which pretty much explains why I’m complaining 
about it so much. I’m pretty sure that was due to the fact that I made 
(and ate) about a dozen cookies the day before though.</p>
<p>The weekend was good as far as training went. I did some sewing on Captain 
Tent for Mr. Boothe, and I made myself a right hand rain mitt out of Epic 
material. Now I just need to make mike some mitts, and myself a left hand 
mitt, and my sewing will be done.</p>
<p>So far today I have been pulled in so many different directions is kind of 
strange. I dealt with my phone line; returned messages; got paid for my final 
weeks of work (though I still need to go to the bank); programmed my <span class="caps">GPS</span> a bit, 
and dealt with some <span class="caps">AIDS</span> fundraising stuff. So many different things, so 
little time. I have to get back to work, but before I do, a report on the 
training that I did, and the fact that I have blisters.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, I did some training by hiking about ten miles out to 
Barney Falls again, and climbing bleachers at Cal. Both were tiring, but today 
I must train more. The hike was really strange because Rachael and I were 
accompanied by a photographer from the Oakland Tribune. Keep your eyes peeled 
for the article on April 18th.</p>
<h2 id="revisiting-the-worst-day-of-all-time">Revisiting the Worst Day of All Time.</h2>
<p><strong>11 April 2005</strong><br/>
Approximately one year ago today, I received in the mail a form from the <span class="caps">DMV</span> 
that told me that me registration on my Mustang was overdue, and that in 
addition to the regular fee, I was being charged a late fee. At the time, it 
was frustrating because I had never been asked for the original fee, and at 
the time I was rather strapped for money. I eventually went down to the <span class="caps">DMV</span>, 
where, after waiting in line for some time, I learned that I had forgot my 
wallet. You can imagine how terrible this was on a hot day in <span class="caps">LA</span> traffic.</p>
<p>I drove home to get it, and calmed down a bit about how frustrating it was 
that the one time in a very long time that I forgot my wallet, this was the 
effect. I got back in my hot car, and drove back to the <span class="caps">DMV</span> (about a half 
hour drive, with no traffic). In addition to having traffic, I actually had to 
wait for a funeral procession to go by. It took a long time, and I had no A/C. 
In the end, I got the late fee waived, got new stickers for my car, and got on 
with life, considering it the worst day of all time, which it was at the time. 
I realize that it doesn’t sound so bad, but there were more details I’ve 
left out for all of our sake.</p>
<p>Today is threatening to be about as bad as that day. For the past month, I 
have been harassing my dad (also my employer) about getting me my tax forms. 
Finally, on Saturday, he got them to me. This left me with about five days to 
get them done - not much time, if any at all really. So today, being the 
earliest time that I could get them in, I called H&amp;R Block to see what 
they could do for me. After telling them some information, I came to learn 
that it looked like I owed about, oh $2,500 by the man’s estimate. About half 
of what I have saved for the trip. This is not good news, so I decide I should 
call my dad to give him a piece of my mind, and ask how the hell this happened. 
He, being the savvy business owner that he is, asks me a number of 
questions, and informs me that I need to get an extension so that his <span class="caps">CPA</span> can 
deal with it when I drive down to San Diego for the Kick Off. Just what I need 
right now. So, here’s the uncertainty with that: I don’t know who’s going to 
pay that money, or how much it is going to come out to. Probably somewhere 
around $1,500 is my guess. More than I would like to part with, especially to 
the war machine. I mean, what would Emerson say?</p>
<p>So that was pretty bad, but I filed the extension over the phone, agreed to 
pay a 1% late fee, and got on with life. The next project was to call the <span class="caps">DMV</span> 
about the notice I got last week informing me that, yet again, I had become 
“delinquent” in my “renewal.” Sigh. here’s the bad news, the car that I 
failed to renew? I gave it to my dad to sell. He sold it to one of his 
employees in Mexico. I don’t know who, but it’s down there, being the good 
Mustang it always was. So. I call the <span class="caps">DMV</span> to ask them what to do about the fee 
I owe on the car I don’t have. The third time I call the number, I don’t get 
the busy signal, and I actually get through to a phone maze of some sort. 
After dialing about ten numbers, I get put on hold for a second. Then, I get 
thrown back into the phone maze, because all operators were busy. So, I go 
through it again, and get put into the queue. This happens three times. 
Eventually, I get through to what sounded like a Vietnamese woman that was 
fresh to America. She barely spoke English, and was quite angry for some 
reason. Why? I don’t know. Anyway, I asked her what to do. She says, file the 
Release of Liability Form, <span class="caps">REG138</span>. Ok, I say. She notes that it will ask who I 
sold the car to. Hell. I don’t know who it’s sold to. My dad sold it in Mexico 
to one of his workers. He probably doesn’t even know my dad anymore. I tell 
her this, and the jist of what she says is, well, you can’t release liability 
without that information. I reiterate that I don’t have it, and she tries to 
hang up on me. I plead, “please, please don’t hang up on me.” Miraculously, 
she does not. I ask again, what can I do if I don’t know their name? She has 
no answers, and barely speaks English, so I ask for a supervisor. No luck. She 
says, I should call the “Registration Control Unit in Sacramento,” and gives 
me a number, 916.767.8035. Happy, I call the number. She was toying with me. 
The number has this message, “At the tone, the time will be 2:22 <span class="caps">PM</span> Pacific 
time. Beep.” She literally gave me the number to the universal time place. I 
am still in shock about that.</p>
<p>So here’s the summary. I owe a couple of grand in taxes. I have a car that 
is mine, but is owned by somebody else. I can either pay $100 for it every 
year, or somehow try to find another answer. It’s <span class="caps">3PM</span>. Today has been terrible, 
but at least I didn’t get stuck behind a funeral procession. Perhaps I hate the 
<span class="caps">DMV</span>. How can it be so bad without people being up in arms? I don’t understand. 
We live in the modern age.</p>

<p><strong>13 April 2005</strong>
Well, it seems that all is well in the world of <span class="caps">PCT</span> planning. For some reason, 
I can’t quite figure out what it is that I should be doing to get ready. 
It’s possible that I’m entirely ready at this point. I have a few things that 
I want to shop for, but the pile of gear that is going with me down to San 
Diego is ready. I can’t really pack for the trip yet because I don’t want to 
compress my sleeping bag, but all else is ready.</p>
<p>My roommate Rachael has told me that I should jot down some of my biggest 
worries for my ever vigilant public. Probably my biggest worries at this point 
are water worries - that one, I won’t get through the desert without some 
serious dehydration, and that two, I won’t get through the Sierra Snow like I 
need to. I have done some thinking about the southern California water 
situation, and I think the thing to do about it is carry a ton of water, keep 
your eye on the next water stop, and hope for the best. I figure if I carry 
six liters, I should have more than enough. Usually that’s cutting it close, 
but I hear that every creek, crik and rivelet is pumping with water this year.</p>
<p>As to what I am going to do about the snow in the sierras, and, more 
importantly, the San Gabriels, I think the plan is to hit it like a ton of 
bricks. It’s not the most brilliant plan, but I think it <em>might</em> just work. I 
think my age might factor into this foolhardy plan. Anyway, we’re going to hit 
it, and perhaps we’ll break fresh trail. Should be interesting anyway.</p>
<p>One other concern that I am harboring at this point is Ken. Ken is my homemade 
sleeping quilt. I’ve had him for about eight or nine months now, but 
I’ve been too afraid to really get out with him much. I have been sleeping 
under him for a good few days now, and I think I can get used to him. If not, 
I’ll have a Feathered Friends Hummingbird waiting for me at my mom’s house in 
San Diego, so worst case scenario, I’ll just have her mail me that.</p>
<p>So, all in all, I think I’m in the calm before the storm. It’s possible 
of course that the storm will never hit, but I’m pretty sure it will. Take 
the following information, and tell me if it adds up nicely: On Friday, I have 
a going away party in Berkeley. On Saturday, I have one in <span class="caps">LA</span>. On Sunday, I 
have one in San Diego. On Monday, I have a date with my dad’s <span class="caps">CPA</span> to do my 
taxes. Hmmm…</p>

<p><strong>19 April 2005</strong><br/>
Well, things are winding down, and it looks like I am about ready to go now. 
The bounce box is packed; I have resupply packages set up for Warner Springs, 
Idyllwild, Wrightwood, Kennedy Meadows, and Ashland; I’ve been on tour for the 
past few days, and have said goodbye to just about everybody I know; and I’ve 
done, filed and paid my taxes (grand total with deductions: ~$500).</p>
<p>Even though it seems like everything is a go, I feel somewhat strange. In a few 
days, I’m going to begin walking. After walking for a few days, I’m 
going to continue walking. Then, after a few weeks of walking, yes, I am going 
to walk some more. Eventually, after five months of it, I will stop walking, 
if and only if I have made it to Canada. Sounds simple, but I get bored easily.
I’ve never done anything quite like this before, so I can only guess how my 
mind and body will react. I’m pretty confident about how my body will react 
(aside from my ankles and hips), but I know my mind is going to go insane at 
least temporarily. I was trying to explain to a friend last night about how 
it will happen when my brain tries to make me quit. I think that at first my 
brain will tell me that I’m bored. Then it will tell me to quit, that there’s 
no point in going on if I’m not having fun. Eventually, I will tell it to go 
away and mind its own business, but it’s harassed me incessantly in the 
past, and it will continue harassing me on and on even after I’ve asked it to 
leave me alone. The trick is going to be telling it to go away, and 
remembering all the reasons that I am on the trail - the beauty, the 
challenge, the isolation.</p>
<p>I guess I have cold feet a little bit right now, but I’m quite excited. I 
know it will be the trip that defines the next chapters in my life, and I know 
that I will leave the trip a changed person.</p>
<p>The next post will be from the trail.</p>
