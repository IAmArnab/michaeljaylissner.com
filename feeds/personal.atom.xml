&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#8217;s donations are larger than any previous year, but largely fall along similar trends as in the past. The larger donations this year (about $1,000-worth) go towards non-profit organizations. The choices this year were hard. After consulting with a few friends, I decided to donate to two new categories: Environmental and&amp;nbsp;Anti-Gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a good environmental organization to give your money is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HARD&lt;/span&gt;. After a few hours of research, I had looked at many organizations that were doing good work. But a lot of those organizations were still trying to prove the point that climate change is an issue, or were focused on small-scale issues. These are both noble goals, but I think what we need now are big solutions on an international level. I&amp;#8217;m no expert in this topic, by far, but I&amp;#8217;m fairly convinced that individual decision making isn&amp;#8217;t going to solve the problem fast enough. It&amp;#8217;s great if we all learn to recycle and to consider environmental impact in our daily lives. That, I don&amp;#8217;t disagree with. But I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s enough. I think we need to start forcing governments and organizations to be cleaner. I&amp;#8217;m convinced that so long as the economic incentives are in place that have led to the current behaviors, the market will follow those incentives. I&amp;#8217;m hopeful that my donation to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions will help bring changes to these&amp;nbsp;incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding an anti-gun organization is easier, especially given the current state of affairs after Sandyhook Elementary School. While I&amp;#8217;m not so sure that anti-gun legislation is going to solve any truly big problems, I hope that donating my money here will help strike while the iron is hot. I simply can&amp;#8217;t believe that the 2nd Amendment pro-gun lobby is as successful as it is, and I am hopeful that we&amp;#8217;ll be able to change the dialog around guns over the next few years. Gun ownership is trending down in the U.S., and I hope that we can accellerate that trend, bringing a cease to the needless gun deaths violence we currently live&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big donations in this year&amp;#8217;s list go mostly towards organizations that I&amp;#8217;ve donated to in the past. Fair Vote and Rootstrikers are organizations that work to fix the current political system. Most Americans (about 70%, I believe) agree that the current Federal legislation system is corrupt, and these organizations are working to fix that. I&amp;#8217;m pessimistic that until these organizations find success, we won&amp;#8217;t be able to deal with the small or large issues facing the country, so these organizations continue to get the plurality of my donation ($400 between them). I think the ridiculous fiscal cliff &amp;#8220;negotiations&amp;#8221; are testament to how bad things have gotten. Our political system is&amp;nbsp;paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other organizations that did well this year include a handful of open-source foundations that I rely on, but which otherwise give away their work for free. My livelihood and these very donations rely on these bits of infrastructure we take for granted, so I figure I should give them some money to keep &amp;#8216;em&amp;nbsp;going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the nitty gritty breakdown of my donations this year (as well as last):

&lt;p&gt;As always, I welcome input on these decisions, and suggestions for the years ahead. Those that made suggestions for this year, I truly appreciate your&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="voting reform"></category><category term="technology"></category><category term="me"></category><category term="donations"></category><category term="charity"></category><category term="campaign finance"></category><category term="alma mater"></category></entry><entry><title>Year in Review: Travel Edition</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2012/12/31/year-in-review-2012-travel-edition-goddamn-too-much-traveling/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-12-31T22:42:05-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2012-12-31:posts/2012/12/31/year-in-review-2012-travel-edition-goddamn-too-much-traveling/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of traveling this year; more than anybody should ever really do. Since I&amp;#8217;m already forgetting all the places I went to, I figured I&amp;#8217;d write it all&amp;nbsp;down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;tally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Trip&lt;/td&gt;&lt;th&gt;Flights&lt;/td&gt;&lt;th&gt;Distance (miles)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;London, Germany, Turkey&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Germany for work&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11362&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Montreal Bike Trip and Visit to Montreal&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5221&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;L.A., San Diego, Colorado backpacking&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2586&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Olympic Peninsula Backpacking&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1356&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Paris, Brussels&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11092&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Law via the Internet Conference at Ithaca&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5454&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOTAL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;52571&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure some things are left out from the beginning of the year, and I&amp;#8217;m still trying to figure out how I ended up doing so much goddamn traveling. For comparison&amp;#8217;s sake, I must note that the Earth is 24,901 around its belly, and this is a total of more than twice&amp;nbsp;that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year will be another banner year, as I already have seven weddings on the books. I don&amp;#8217;t think there will be so many trips to Europe though. That&amp;#8217;ll make the biggest&amp;nbsp;difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just hope I have enough suits. It&amp;#8217;s gonna be&amp;nbsp;crazy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="travel"></category><category term="me"></category></entry><entry><title>Presentation on Juriscraper and CourtListener for LVI2012</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2012/10/09/presentation-on-juriscraper-and-courtlistener-for-lvi2012/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-09T19:42:47-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2012-10-09:posts/2012/10/09/presentation-on-juriscraper-and-courtlistener-for-lvi2012/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday and today I&amp;#8217;ve been in Ithaca, New York, participating in the Law

money to a handful of organizations at the beginning of every year. This 
year I picked the organizations that had a major effect on me personally, 
are fixing environmental problems, or are working towards fixing the 
American political&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll see that I&amp;#8217;ve given the most money to organizations that are working 
to reform voting methods, and campaign finance. I believe that if those two 
things were fixed properly, we&amp;#8217;d have good people in office that could fix 
all of the other issues we see from day to&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

One of them has been 
teaching &lt;a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i153-waim/su10/"&gt;Web Architecture and Information Management&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt; Berkeley 
with two other guys from the School of Information. It&amp;#8217;s been a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TON&lt;/span&gt; of work
 for not a whole lot of pay, but it&amp;#8217;s been really&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the three of us split up the work, I only have to do about four 
lectures, but the class is two and a half hours long three times a week, 
which is a lot of talking time. I imagine it&amp;#8217;s not easy for the students to
 be in the class that frequently&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m giving lectures on the following&amp;nbsp;topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested, I&amp;#8217;ve posted my slides for these in the &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/projects-and-papers"&gt;projects and 
papers&lt;/a&gt; section of the site. It&amp;#8217;s definitely true that the best way to 
learn it to&amp;nbsp;teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also been learning a little about how to get the class to participate 
and be involved, but that&amp;#8217;s probably the most challenging part. A lot of 
the students know a lot about the material, and are pretty bored, 
while others are seeing everything for the first time. It makes it pretty 
tricky, but it&amp;#8217;s working out as the class gets to know each other. We 
started doing student presentations this week, and that has helped 
everybody get a little more skin in the&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Web Architecture"></category><category term="teaching"></category><category term="summer"></category><category term="Cal"></category><category term="me"></category></entry><entry><title>2010 Donations</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/01/12/2010-donations/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-01-12T16:28:02-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2010-01-12:posts/2010/01/12/2010-donations/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every year, a handful of organizations reach out to me to give them my money.

I mean really. We can see how hot things are using infrared cameras. We can put infrared cameras in microwaves. Why must we always type in a length of time that we want things to cook for, when really, all we want is to press a button labeled &amp;#8220;Make my food&amp;nbsp;hot.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I finally looked into this idea today. It&amp;#8217;s been &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=MLYlAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=5693247"&gt;patented by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LG&lt;/span&gt; since 1997&lt;/a&gt;. So, there goes that&amp;nbsp;idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish they would make one. Imagine a microwave where you dial the power level, then press go. When the food is hot, it stops. Ah, the future&amp;#8230;err&amp;#8230;the 1997 patent that never went anywhere. Maybe we can free this patent because it&amp;#8217;s not &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness"&gt;non-obvious&lt;/a&gt; anymore.&amp;nbsp;Doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="patent"></category><category term="microwave oven"></category></entry><entry><title>The Latest Books and Classes</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/02/01/the-latest-books-and-classes/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-02-01T14:45:21-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-02-01:posts/2009/02/01/the-latest-books-and-classes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, another semester has begun at the School of Information, and so I figured I&amp;#8217;d share my latest classes and&amp;nbsp;books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now, I&amp;#8217;ve boiled my classes down to the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixing and Remixing&amp;nbsp;Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface&amp;nbsp;Aesthetics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social and Organizational Issues of&amp;nbsp;Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategic Computing and Communications&amp;nbsp;Technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Law and&amp;nbsp;Policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyberlaw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And somehow, I only had to buy three books and four readers this semester, for a total of $315. Somehow, this is more than last semester when I had five books and four readers. Oh well. The books from this semester&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network&amp;nbsp;Economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software and Internet&amp;nbsp;Law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro Web 2.0&amp;nbsp;Mashups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, classes are going well, but at least one of them will need to get cut. It&amp;#8217;s going to be hard to decide, but luckily I don&amp;#8217;t have to for another few&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="ischool"></category><category term="books"></category></entry><entry><title>Meyer Lissner Was Famous</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/12/31/meyer-lissner-was-famous-go-figure/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-12-31T13:50:36-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-12-31:posts/2008/12/31/meyer-lissner-was-famous-go-figure/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There has been some talk in my family over the years about my great

It being a one-way street, I looked left, saw no cars for a block and a half, and casually walked across the road, against the traffic light&amp;#8217;s firm instruction. I continued walking for another third of a block, and then heard a siren blare behind me &lt;em&gt;on the sidewalk&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, I was getting pulled over (so to speak), by a motorcycle cop (now illegally riding on the sidewalk) for defying a traffic light while on foot. I was &amp;ndash; and still am &amp;ndash; in shock. I expressed my disbelief to the officer, &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re kidding right?&amp;#8221; He was not. &amp;#8220;You have better things to do with your time, right?&amp;#8221; He did not. He told me a woeful tale of how he has to call parents in the middle of the night to tell them that their child had been hit while crossing the road. I informed him that I was in fact a professional walker that literally walked halfway across the continent, and that I was pretty much &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; crossing the street. He insisted he was doing me a favor, and teaching me a&amp;nbsp;lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 20 minutes that I stalled the guy, I did my best to make him realize that what he was doing was a waste of time, good faith and resources. I realized then and I realize now that this is the minority position when being ticketed by the cops, and I don&amp;#8217;t think it helped me get out of the ticket. The whole time I was arguing with the guy though, I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but think about all the waste that is caused by meaningless laws. Jay walking. Full-stops at stop signs. Waiting at red lights at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;3AM&lt;/span&gt;. The list goes&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these things waste time, and don&amp;#8217;t have particularly good purposes. We live for only so long, and how much of our time is stuck waiting because of laws that take morality, judgment, and reason out of the picture? Clearly, there is room for improvement, but somehow cops feel comfortable (righteous?) about giving these kinds of&amp;nbsp;tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety-three dollars later, and I&amp;#8217;ve cleared my name of this heinous crime on humanity. Surely something is wrong though, when cops have nothing better to do than to give this kind of ticket. Can&amp;#8217;t we find better ways to use our&amp;nbsp;resources? &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="concord"></category><category term="police"></category><category term="frustration"></category></entry><entry><title>More Details On Fire Last Night</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/11/14/more-details-on-the-fire-last-night/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-11-14T13:29:56-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-11-14:posts/2008/11/14/more-details-on-the-fire-last-night/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happened?&lt;/strong&gt;
Last night around midnight, we heard a crash&amp;#8230;might have been more like a bang. I thought it sounded like a bucket of junk falling off a shelf. When we looked outside to see what the sound was, we saw a car on fire across the street. I immediately called 911 and reported it. I had a fire extinguisher, but they kindly urged me not to use it. Not sure if I would have if they hadn&amp;#8217;t. At that point, the fire was pretty small by comparison to the video, so I&amp;#8217;m not totally&amp;nbsp;insane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first saw the car, the fire was only &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; the top of the back of the car, which is what leads me to believe that the fire came from the outside, and that the bang was the impact of the molotov cocktail. Within a few minutes, the flame from the outside of the car had penetrated the gasoline tank, and gas was pouring onto the ground forming a flaming puddle. I believe the large explosion seen in the video is the gas tank getting hot enough to explode. This in turn led to the power lines melting and falling in a dramatic fashion onto the nearby&amp;nbsp;Honda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about another two minutes, the fire department arrived and quickly put out the fire. It was fortunate that they arrived when they did because there is a large tree over the car that could have easily spread the fire to the neighboring&amp;nbsp;buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another hour or so, the fire was out in both cars (it spread to the one next to it), and the electrical wire was neutralized. The news team came, but I didn&amp;#8217;t want to do an interview. Nevertheless though, I did give them my movie, and they tell me it aired on the 5-9 morning&amp;nbsp;news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve been living here for about 4 years now. The hood has some issues which I&amp;#8217;ve put some effort into trying to fix. Since living here, I&amp;#8217;ve seen a guy chase another with a knife, I&amp;#8217;ve cleaned up about 6 hypodermic needles, I learned of a bullet hole in a neighbor&amp;#8217;s window, and I&amp;#8217;ve heard from my window a murder from about a block and a half away. Now I can add molotov cocktail to the&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these things I know about only because I&amp;#8217;m involved in the neighborhood, and I can chalk up to things that most people would be blissfully ignorant of. Others, like the arson and the knife chase are hard to&amp;nbsp;ignore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like living in Berkeley, and I like my living situation - good roommates, affordable rent, a nice house - but it&amp;#8217;s times like today when I have to reflect on why I am living across the street from a drug dealer, and if it&amp;#8217;s really safe and practical for me and for others. My usual policy is to mind my own business, and they&amp;#8217;ll leave me alone, which is quite true, but still, exploding cars are hard to&amp;nbsp;ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years I have been telling friends that it&amp;#8217;s safe to come here, that their car will be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, and not to worry, that I have been fine for years. I&amp;#8217;m still fine, but I think it might be a harder sale these days. I just hope things get better, not&amp;nbsp;worse.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="berkeley"></category><category term="fire"></category><category term="crime"></category><category term="arson"></category></entry><entry><title>Car Arson Across The Street From My House</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/11/14/car-arson-across-the-street-from-my-house/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-11-14T01:59:11-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-11-14:posts/2008/11/14/car-arson-across-the-street-from-my-house/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m guessing &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd13wCaRfJA"&gt;it was a Molotov cocktail&lt;/a&gt;.

last day at work with the &lt;a href="http://ehsd.org/comm000.html"&gt;Community 
Services Bureau&lt;/a&gt; of Contra Costa&amp;nbsp;County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve never worked somewhere for so long - all in all,  it was about three 
years, during which time I progressed from Temp Clerk to Intermediate Clerk 
to Assistant Manager. You do gotta love working in&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, I&amp;#8217;ve been planning on quitting since about December of 2006, when I 
first applied to go back to school. Now that it&amp;#8217;s a year and a half later, 
I&amp;#8217;m surprised I&amp;#8217;m not more excited or elated about this change. It&amp;#8217;s possible 
it hasn&amp;#8217;t sunk in yet because I have been on vacation for the past two weeks 
(and am used to not going to work), but ultimately, I feel pretty normal, 
which is&amp;nbsp;odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is the first day of school at the &lt;a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu"&gt;Berkeley

&lt;li&gt;Information Organization and&amp;nbsp;Retrieval&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributing Computing Applications and&amp;nbsp;Infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;

It has been nothing short of&amp;nbsp;awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was in Lima for one night, after which point, we left to go to 
the Amazon Basin, specifically Puerto Maldonado. In Puerto Maldonado, we were 
picked up by our guide, and quickly ushered down the Tambopata river. From our 
jungle lodge, we had a number of rather excellent excursions. We went to a 
bird clay lick, where we saw a fair amount of birds, including red maccaws. We 
went to a jungle farm, and learned about their practices, and ate a bunch of 
fruit (some normal, some strange). We climbed a tower into the jungle canopy 
and did some bird watching from there, and we spent a night camping in the 
jungle. On that last excursion, we saw the most poisonous spider in Peru (I 
think), and saw some other spiders that I have to admit were damned frightening. 
So far, no malaria, or other jungle diseases to speak&amp;nbsp;of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment we are in Cusco, which is effectively the tourist capital of Peru. 
Today we saw the Sacred Valley, and tomorrow we head out on a four-day hike 
along the Inca trail, culminating at Machu&amp;nbsp;Piccu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, we head to Arequipa, and from there, to Lima and then&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="Peru"></category></entry><entry><title>My Linux Story</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/07/17/my-linux-story/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-17T20:03:38-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-07-17:posts/2008/07/17/my-linux-story/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought I would post a quick entry today about how I came to be a Linux user and enthusiast. I guess it&amp;#8217;s a combination of a couple&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, what happened was that I was using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XP&lt;/span&gt; and looking at thumbnails of some pictures in their file navigator. I was looking at about 300 pictures, and I didn&amp;#8217;t want to open them all up individually (this was before useful apps like Picasa came around). I just wanted to look at the thumbnails. Except those were too small, so I wanted to make them bigger. I spent about two hours searching online to try to figure out how to make such an adjustment. Eventually, I discovered a Windows &amp;#8220;Powertool&amp;#8221; that you could install. It seemed like overkill, but it did the job. What bugged me though about it was that obviously it didn&amp;#8217;t require a Powertool to adjust image size. It just required a tweak of some bit of code somewhere in the system. That was my tipping point. I decided I couldn&amp;#8217;t take the viruses, the expense and the closed product anymore, and promptly decided it was time for a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s what brought me to Linux. What kept me here is the openness and the philosophy. Sure, at times it&amp;#8217;s a bit trickier to get certain things done, but I love the philosophy that if I want a change, I can either make it myself if I am a programmer, or I can file a feature request with the developers. Somebody will read that request, and maybe it will get integrated, if it&amp;#8217;s a good enough&amp;nbsp;idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also love the fact that I can download, install and run an excellent email server, and a top-notch web server. For free. Also, no viruses. Ever. Nor any anti-virus software to pay for. And did I mention the whole thing is&amp;nbsp;free? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the day to day stuff, I really don&amp;#8217;t notice much difference. At work, I use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XP&lt;/span&gt;, which involves using Firefox, Word, Excel and Outlook (the latter three of which my work paid good money for). At home it&amp;#8217;s Firefox, Open Office and Evolution, all of which are very similar to the Microsoft package, only with better compatibility with other&amp;nbsp;programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I really like about my Linux system is the ability to set things up like in the previous tutorial. I did an Internet search for &amp;#8220;Linux wake on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;, and knew exactly how to adjust the system in a matter of moments. That kind of customization is a power you just don&amp;#8217;t have in&amp;nbsp;Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Linux"></category><category term="me"></category></entry><entry><title>My Eyeballs</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/06/25/my-eyeballs/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-06-25T21:27:17-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-06-25:posts/2008/06/25/my-eyeballs/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My eye" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/eyeball.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a picture of my&amp;nbsp;eye.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category></entry><entry><title>The Mission: Results</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/04/15/the-mission-results/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-15T22:17:28-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-04-15:posts/2008/04/15/the-mission-results/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#8217;s been a month, and the results are in. For the past month, I&amp;#8217;ve been &lt;a href="/blog/the-mission"&gt;trying to realize some pretty ambitious goals,&lt;/a&gt; and let me tell you, it has not been&amp;nbsp;easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, and perhaps most important goal was to &amp;#8220;avoid single-passenger car usage at all costs.&amp;#8221; For the most part, this goal has been a success. To achieve this goal, I have had to change my behavior and paradigms pretty radically. For my daily commute, I changed from a 25 minute car ride to a 45 minute bike and train ride. For groceries, I had to carry a massive backpack full of food, and for everything else, I have been riding my bike all around town. The one time I failed at this goal was when my car broke (somebody else was driving it), and it had to get to a mechanic. For that, I apologize, but what can you&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second goal was to jump a rope 500 times daily. I have failed at this goal for a couple of reasons. The first is travel. I did a fair amount of travel during the past month, and it&amp;#8217;s a tiring thing to do. I don&amp;#8217;t like jumping rope after traveling. That&amp;#8217;s a fact. The second reason is that I was doing &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of other exercise during the past month. I biked about 120 miles during my commute, I played soccer and basketball, and I hiked about 30 miles. Am I really supposed to jump rope after all&amp;nbsp;that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next goal was flossing. I flossed pretty much every day during the period, but I did forget to bring it during one of the vacations mentioned above, so I didn&amp;#8217;t floss during those nights. I was lucky enough to have a dentist (dis)appointment during the month, wherein I learned that I have three fresh, new cavities in my mouth, so that helped to make the flossing goal a success (sort&amp;nbsp;of).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No hydrogenated oil. This was a pretty easy one all in all. I failed once, when in a meeting it just was kind of unavoidable because of social circumstances. I made up for it though by persuading a friend not to eat hydrogenated oil at a later date, so my karma is good there. This stuff is all over the place in food. It&amp;#8217;s pretty surprising where it turns up when you start looking for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the reading a half hour goal, it was a piece of cake since I was riding public transportation anyway. I did neglect it on the weekends, but I think the balance came out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a lot of detail, I know. More than you probably wanted, but I wanted to get it on paper (so to speak). The real outcomes of this are not those of the 30 days, but rather the outcomes of long-term change in my habits. I can say that this was a rather challenging process, and I didn&amp;#8217;t really enjoy it the entire time. It made me a lot more tired each day, and the commuting made me have to get up earlier, so that was tough. Figuring out how to do things by bike has a learning curve as well, which was also stressful at&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it is all said and done though, I can say that this has been a positive experience. I am planning on continuing most of the goals (floss, oil, car and reading), but I think the jump rope can leave my life at this&amp;nbsp;point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two answers to the question of whether the mission was a success. I did not achieve any of the goals without some kind of qualifier, so in that regard, no the mission has failed. However, on the other hand, it has created lasting change in me, so in that regard, the mission is a great&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category></entry><entry><title>Something New…and Some Updates</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/04/01/something-new-and-some-updates/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-01T22:45:48-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-04-01:posts/2008/04/01/something-new-and-some-updates/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m starting something new.

&lt;p&gt;I am elated to announce that yesterday I heard from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UW&lt;/span&gt;, and today I heard from Cal. They have both officially offered me entrance into the Fall 2008 class.&amp;nbsp;Amazing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied to the program at Cal last year and was denied, so I didn&amp;#8217;t really expect them to let me in this year, but things are looking up. Now I just have to decide which one to go&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UW&lt;/span&gt; is a bigger program with seemingly more resources, but Cal is a smaller, leaner, and more personalized.

I&amp;#8217;ve tried three times now to read his most excellent &lt;em&gt;People&amp;#8217;s History of the United States&lt;/em&gt;, but I have always failed for one reason or another. I guess it&amp;#8217;s just too dense for everyday, casual reading. This time however, I stumbled upon a much more readable book by him, &lt;em&gt;Passionate Declarations&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s tying in rather well with some thoughts I&amp;#8217;ve been having about our electorate system, so I thought I would post a quick quote from it to share the wealth:&lt;blockquote&gt;What sorts of values and ideals are encouraged in the young people of the coming generation by the enormous emphasis on the Founding Fathers and the presidents? It seems to me that the result is the creation of dependency on powerful political figures to solve our&amp;nbsp;problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were being exploited by England? Well, the Founding Fathers took care of that in leading the struggle for independence. Was the nation morally blighted by the existence of 4 million black slaves? Abraham Lincoln solved that with the Emancipation Proclamation. Did we have a terrible economic crisis in the early 1930s? Franklin Roosevelt got us out of that one. Do we face enormous problems today? Well, the solution is to find the right president, to go to the polls and choose either the Republican or Democratic&amp;nbsp;candidate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how much attention is given in historical writing to military affairs&amp;mdash;to wars and battles&amp;mdash;and how many of our heroes are military heroes. And consider also how little attention is given to antiwar movements and to those who struggled against the idiocy of&amp;nbsp;war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of omitting, or downplaying, the importance of social movements of the people in our history&amp;#8230;a fundamental principle of democracy is undermined: the principle that it is the citizenry, rather than the government, that is the ultimate source of power and the locomotive that pulls the train of government in the direction of equality and justice. Such histories create a passive and subordinate citizenry. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think I could put it much better than that, but in related news, I completed the first round of election pollster training today. Come February 5, I shall be a clerk of the polls (for better or&amp;nbsp;worse).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="politics"></category><category term="history"></category><category term="elections"></category><category term="zinn"></category></entry><entry><title>Volunteering At Last!</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/13/volunteering-at-last/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-13T21:17:09-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-01-13:posts/2008/01/13/volunteering-at-last/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of years I&amp;#8217;ve kinda, sorta been hunting on and off for 
a place where I could volunteer some of my free time. I started at the 
nearby university, thinking that I might be able to convince some kind 
professor to teach me some things. When that failed, 
I tried searching google for nonprofits that looked interesting. Failing 
that, I went on a limb, and asked a professor of mine if he had any ideas 
(he did, but they fell&amp;nbsp;through). &lt;/p&gt;

together old computers into useful devices, and then installing Ubuntu or 
Suse. In exchange, they will give computers (for free) to needy&amp;nbsp;parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not helping the homeless, but it should be educational for me and,

a limit they&amp;#8217;ll give you. You wait for the balance transfer checks to 
arrive in a week or two, and you write yourself a check for the amount of 
the credit limit. You invest that money for as long as the card remains at 
0.0% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APR&lt;/span&gt;. When that period is up, you pay off the card, and the game&amp;nbsp;ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, that was a total of $10,000, and one year, 
so if I find a place to invest that $10,000 at, say, 5%, 
I make $500 over the course of a year, all at no&amp;nbsp;cost.&amp;sup1;&amp;nbsp;&amp;sup2;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here&amp;#8217;s where things get a bit tricky&amp;#8230;I&amp;#8217;m not satisfied with 5%, 
so I decided to invest it in a mutual fund, half as an experiment, 
half cause the odds were indeed in my favor. My risk was doing well&amp;#8230;I was
up&amp;#8230;and then, this happened with no&amp;nbsp;explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/chrtsrv.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any ideas out there as to what happened? I still have six months before I 
have to pay Visa back, but nevertheless, this is&amp;nbsp;annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;sup1; If you don&amp;#8217;t read footnotes, this game is not for&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;sup2; Two things to bear in mind here. One is to get a card with no balance
transfer fees. The other is that your credit score will take a temporary 
hit during this ordeal (but I have it on good authority that it will 
recover&amp;nbsp;quickly).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="money"></category></entry><entry><title>My Destiny To Have A Beard</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/10/03/destiny-to-have-a-beard/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-03T23:17:34-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-10-03:posts/2007/10/03/destiny-to-have-a-beard/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been doing some thinking, and I think that my destiny* wants me to have
a beard. Let&amp;#8217;s take a quick walk through my past, shall&amp;nbsp;we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I was into woodworking. I described it as, &amp;#8220;My first great 
passion.&amp;#8221; Observe this picture. It&amp;#8217;s the first hit on google images for
the word&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;woodworker&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/bearded-destiny/wood.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, after sort of putting woodworking aside for a while, 
I got really into hiking; thru hiking to be precise. This picture is the 
third or fourth hit for &amp;#8220;thru hiker&amp;#8221; on google images, 
but I hasten to add that it is the first hit that contains a picture of a&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/bearded-destiny/thru.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as you may have noticed, I&amp;#8217;m pretty into Linux these days. It&amp;#8217;s 
could be a phase as well (we&amp;#8217;ll see), but observe this image, 
also pulled from google images. Admittedly it&amp;#8217;s not hit number one, 
but I don&amp;#8217;t count pictures of college kids or penguins out of&amp;nbsp;principle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/bearded-destiny/linux.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. It seems I should have a beard. There is a problem with this plan 
though, and to illustrate that problem, I have this picture of me, 
when I tried it for myself.&amp;nbsp;Damn.&lt;/p&gt;

them in oil for a few days to make some bread dip. I had a strange quantity of
virgin oil and fresh peeled garlic on hand, but I lacked the rosemary, so I 
grabbed a friend and went walking in the neighborhood, looking for a garden to&amp;nbsp;rob. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked for a few blocks in the dark with a flashlight looking for rosemary, 
but we weren&amp;#8217;t finding any. We found some mint and some tomatoes in a garden 
near our house, but no rosemary. Then a nice lady walked by with something in 
her hand that looked like a plant. I said, &amp;#8220;Hey, do you know any houses around 
here that might have rosemary?&amp;#8221; She said, &amp;#8220;&amp;#191;necisita rosemary?&amp;#8221; and held 
up the sprig she had in her hand. We chatted a bit, and she gave me a sprig off 
the plant she was bringing&amp;nbsp;home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#8217;m not a religious man, and in fact I don&amp;#8217;t believe in anything that 
can&amp;#8217;t be seen (ghosts, goblins, Zeus, god, angels, et al included). Sometimes 
I can see why others believe though. I mean, what are the&amp;nbsp;odds? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving home, a roommate described it as, &amp;#8220;A modest miracle.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="Cooking"></category><category term="Religion"></category></entry></feed>
