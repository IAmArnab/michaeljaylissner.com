beginning to wind down. I still have at least 60 pages of writing to do in 
the next two weeks, but somehow it will get done. One class that I 
&lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; finished my final project work for is &lt;a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290-20/s09/"&gt;Interface 
Aesthetics&lt;/a&gt;, which was a survey class covering typography, color, 
layout, web design, and a handful of other&amp;nbsp;topics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the final project, we each made &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/interface-aesthetics.ppt"&gt;presentations of our work from the 
semester&lt;/a&gt;, and on Monday from 4:10 to 6pm we will be 
holding an &lt;a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/newsandevents/events/20090511exhibition"&gt;open house&lt;/a&gt; to share our work at the iSchool. A lot of it
 is really quite good, though this presentation is what I will be showing, 
 so this is one cat that&amp;#8217;s out of the&amp;nbsp;bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the work in the attached could still use some refinement, 
but I will point you towards the ones titled &amp;#8220;Type I,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Type &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;#8221; 
and &amp;#8220;Icons,&amp;#8221; which I think came out pretty&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="project"></category><category term="interface aesthetics"></category></entry></feed>
