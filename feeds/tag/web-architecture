&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; numbers in all of our case URLs. This change meant that links that were 
previously like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;http:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//courtlistener.com/scotus/Wong-v.-Smith/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Are now like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;http:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//courtlistener.com/scotus/V5o/wong-v-smith/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Most of the old links should continue to work, but using the new links should 
be much faster and more reliable. The major difference between the two is the 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; number, which is encoded as a set of numbers (in this case &lt;em&gt;V5o&lt;/em&gt;). This 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; corresponds directly with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; number in our database, aiding us greatly 
in serving up cases quickly and&amp;nbsp;accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time as this change, we added social networking links to all 
of our case pages to make them easier to share with friends and colleagues. 
These links use our new tiny domain, &lt;em&gt;http://crt.li/&lt;/em&gt;, and should thus be 
ideal for websites like Twitter or&amp;nbsp;Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few months we will be getting a major new server, and will be 
migrating our data to it. This will allow us to serve more data, 
and&amp;mdash;drum roll please&amp;mdash;will allow us to begin serving audio content 
on the site. That&amp;#8217;s right, in the next few months, we will begin getting oral 
arguments from the circuit courts, and will be serving it directly to you on 
the case&amp;nbsp;pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have plans to revisit our search interface in order to add date 
filtering and query building so look for that&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we welcome your feedback and support, so don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to get in 
touch with us if you have any questions or&amp;nbsp;suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="CourtListener"></category><category term="Web Architecture"></category><category term="database"></category></entry><entry><title>Lecturing at UC Berkeley</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2010/07/30/lecturing-at-uc-berkeley/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-07-30T13:10:56-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2010-07-30:posts/2010/07/30/lecturing-at-uc-berkeley/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This summer I&amp;#8217;ve been busy with a number of things. One of them has been 
teaching &lt;a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i153-waim/su10/"&gt;Web Architecture and Information Management&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt; Berkeley 
with two other guys from the School of Information. It&amp;#8217;s been a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TON&lt;/span&gt; of work
 for not a whole lot of pay, but it&amp;#8217;s been really&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the three of us split up the work, I only have to do about four 
lectures, but the class is two and a half hours long three times a week, 
which is a lot of talking time. I imagine it&amp;#8217;s not easy for the students to
 be in the class that frequently&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m giving lectures on the following&amp;nbsp;topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested, I&amp;#8217;ve posted my slides for these in the &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/projects-and-papers"&gt;projects and 
papers&lt;/a&gt; section of the site. It&amp;#8217;s definitely true that the best way to 
learn it to&amp;nbsp;teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also been learning a little about how to get the class to participate 
and be involved, but that&amp;#8217;s probably the most challenging part. A lot of 
the students know a lot about the material, and are pretty bored, 
while others are seeing everything for the first time. It makes it pretty 
tricky, but it&amp;#8217;s working out as the class gets to know each other. We 
started doing student presentations this week, and that has helped 
everybody get a little more skin in the&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Web Architecture"></category><category term="teaching"></category><category term="summer"></category><category term="Cal"></category><category term="me"></category></entry></feed>
