you to figure out how much energy your existence consumes on a daily basis.
It&amp;#8217;s a pretty useful site because it asks pretty thorough questions, 
and then reports on you vs. historical American, you vs. the world, 
you vs. lightbulbs, etc. Here&amp;#8217;s my consumption of&amp;nbsp;energy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/wattzon.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool right? Who knew that my biggest environmental damage is coming 
from government? Here&amp;#8217;s me vs. historical&amp;nbsp;Americans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/wattzon2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m doing pretty well relative to the average American, 
and I need to follow Thoreau&amp;#8217;s advice about not paying my taxes.

After reading &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/05/15/meet-my-enemy/"&gt;my post
regarding my hate of Fiji water&lt;/a&gt;, Fiji has responded by &lt;a href="http://www.fijigreen.com"&gt;creating a new 
website&lt;/a&gt; that tries to lure consumers out of their&amp;nbsp;minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s great that Fiji Water wants to lower their carbon impact, 
but come on folks. Talk about green-washing. This is just stupid. If you 
care about the environment, stop bottling water in Fiji. Actually, 
just stop bottling&amp;nbsp;water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="environment"></category><category term="water"></category></entry><entry><title>Meet My Enemy</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/05/15/meet-my-enemy/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-15T22:26:41-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-05-15:posts/2008/05/15/meet-my-enemy/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like everybody to meet my new enemy, and that of my girlfriend, 
who is now working against bottled water. Behold Fuji: traveler from 
distant seas, pillager of distant islands, waster of petroleum, 
and emptier of&amp;nbsp;pockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No Alt" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/Fiji bottle_0.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, not only is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/products?q=fiji+water&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;scoring=p"&gt;Fiji water expensive&lt;/a&gt;, but it also &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COMES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIJI&lt;/span&gt;!!!! 
Think about that for a moment. Fiji is an island in the middle of the 
Pacific. Behold the planet Earth, and the island of&amp;nbsp;Fiji:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=fiji&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=6"&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/FijiMap2.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, the water must get from there to here (it&amp;#8217;s about 5,
500 miles to the bay area). Luckily, the bottle is square so they can fit a
lot of it on a ship, but it must be bottled for weeks and months before it
arrives here. Why are we pillaging this island? It&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;madness.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="water"></category><category term="environment"></category></entry><entry><title>The Vision</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/04/15/the-vision/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-15T22:33:39-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-04-15:posts/2008/04/15/the-vision/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you have been reading this blog for any length of time, you are probably aware that I am a huge environmentalist. You may not clearly understand just how huge an environmentalist I am though. Lately, I have been doing some thinking about my long-term goals, and some of them are coming into some&amp;nbsp;clarity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to build a house and live in&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want my house to be made while maintaining a neutral carbon impact. If I 
use trees to build my house, I want those materials to be renewed before my&amp;nbsp;death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to stop using petroleum and coal altogether. No cars. No 
petroleum fed food. Only clean energy. Offsets for all things outside the realm of the&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to achieve the above&amp;nbsp;comfortably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog, these goals seem a little silly, but I have been thinking about variations of these for many years, and they are indeed quite serious, real&amp;nbsp;goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, putting them out there in public makes me look and feel like an extremist, like a crazy person outside of what is considered the norm - outside even of the margins. I think I can do it though, and I think I need to get to work soon if I am going to feel like my life has been a&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I need is money. More of it. Lots more of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="environment"></category></entry></feed>
