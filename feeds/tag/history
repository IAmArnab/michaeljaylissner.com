Part of that feature is going to be some basic information about the courts themselves, so I spent some time over the weekend researching courts that served a special purpose but were since&amp;nbsp;abolished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such court was the &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Emergency_Court_of_Appeals"&gt;Emergency Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;. It was created during World War &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; to set prices, and, naturally, was the court of appeals for many cases. The creation date of the court is prominently published in various places on the Internet, but the abolishment history of the court was very difficult to find. After researching online for some time, and learning that my library card had expired (sigh), I put in a query with the &lt;a href="http://www.loc.gov"&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt;, which provides free research of these types of&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a couple days, the provided me with this amazing response, 
 which I&amp;#8217;m sharing here, and on the above Wikipedia&amp;nbsp;article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated in the Legislative Notes to 50 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Code Appendix § 921 to 926, 
as posted at http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50a/usc_sec_50a_00000921&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;000-notes.html, 
the following explanation is given regarding the amendment and repeal of Act 
of Jan. 30, 1942, ch. 26, title &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;, § 204, 56 Stat. 23,&amp;nbsp;31-33: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Section 924, acts Jan. 30, 1942, ch. 26, title &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;, § 204, 
56 Stat. 31; June 30, 1944, ch. 325, title I, § 107, 58 Stat. 639; June 30, 
1945, ch. 214, § 6, 59 Stat. 308; July 30, 1947, ch. 361, title I, § 101, 
61 Stat. 619; June 25, 1948, ch. 646, § 32(a), 62 Stat. 991; May 24, 1949, 
ch. 139, § 127, 63 Stat. 107, authorized review of orders of the Office of 
Price Administrator under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 
and created the Emergency Court of Appeals for this purpose. The Emergency 
Price Control Act of 1942 terminated on June 30, 1947, 
under the provisions of act July 25, 1946, ch. 671, § 1, 
60 Stat. 664. The Housing and Rent Act of 1948, act Mar. 30, 1948, ch. 161, 
62 Stat. 93, classified to section 1881 of this Appendix, 
continued the Court for the purpose of reviewing recommendations of local 
advisory boards for the decontrol or adjustment of maximum rents. Later, 
the Defense Production Act of 1950, act Sept. 8, 1950, ch. 932, 
64 Stat. 798, classified to sections 2061 to 2166 of this Appendix, 
continued the Court to review regulations and orders relating to price 
control. The Housing and Rent Act of 1948 and the Defense Production Act of 
1950 both terminated, however, the Court remained in existence &amp;#8220;to complete 
the adjudication of rights and liabilities incurred prior to their 
termination dates.&amp;#8221; (Transcript of Proceedings of the Final Session of the 
Court, 299 F.2d 1.) The final decision of the Court, Rosenzweig v. General 
Services Administration, 1961, 299 F.2d 22, was decided on Dec. 6, 
1961. A petition for rehearing was denied on Jan. 2, 1962, 
and a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United 
States was denied on Mar. 19, 1962, 82 S. Ct.&amp;nbsp;830. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order of Chief Judge Albert B. Maris, set forth in 299 F.2d 20,&amp;nbsp;provided: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business of this Court having been completed, it is ordered that at the
expiration of 30 days from this date, if a petition for certiorari has not 
been filed in the Supreme Court in Case No. 676 [Rosenzweig v. General 
Services Administration], just decided, the acting clerk shall deliver the 
records and papers of the Court in his office to the General Services 
Administration for permanent custody as records of the Government, 
and shall thereupon inform the Chief Justice of the United States that the 
work of the Court has been completed and that the designations of the judges
 of the Court may therefore appropriately be&amp;nbsp;terminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a petition for certiorari is filed in Case No. 676 this order shall take
effect and be carried out at the expiration of 30 days after the final 
disposition of Case No.&amp;nbsp;676.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the terms of this order, the petition for certiorari 
having been filed, and denied Mar. 19, 1962, the Court terminated on Apr. 18,&amp;nbsp;1962.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty fantastic research. And for free!

grandfather, Meyer Lissner. Over the holidays, I scanned some old photos, 
and discovered that he was quite the famous fellow. Below is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_ships"&gt;liberty 
ship&lt;/a&gt; that was named after him in&amp;nbsp;1943.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Liberty ship named Meyer Lissner" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/liberty-ship.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned that my grandfather donated a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of his 
papers to the Stanford Library as the &lt;a href="http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf858006bb&amp;amp;chunk.id=did-1.8.1&amp;amp;brand=oac"&gt;Meyer Lissner Papers&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;#8217;t 
read up much on him yet, but he seems pretty influential to California 
history as part of a reform&amp;nbsp;movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting stuff. I&amp;#8217;m going to have to do some researching on this fellow 
one of these&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="history"></category><category term="Meyer Lissner"></category><category term="California"></category></entry><entry><title>Howard Zinn on “The Use and Abuse of History”</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/19/howard-zinn-the-use-and-abuse-of-history/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-19T00:29:03-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-01-19:posts/2008/01/19/howard-zinn-the-use-and-abuse-of-history/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been reading some excellent stuff by Howard Zinn of late. I&amp;#8217;ve tried three times now to read his most excellent &lt;em&gt;People&amp;#8217;s History of the United States&lt;/em&gt;, but I have always failed for one reason or another. I guess it&amp;#8217;s just too dense for everyday, casual reading. This time however, I stumbled upon a much more readable book by him, &lt;em&gt;Passionate Declarations&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s tying in rather well with some thoughts I&amp;#8217;ve been having about our electorate system, so I thought I would post a quick quote from it to share the wealth:&lt;blockquote&gt;What sorts of values and ideals are encouraged in the young people of the coming generation by the enormous emphasis on the Founding Fathers and the presidents? It seems to me that the result is the creation of dependency on powerful political figures to solve our&amp;nbsp;problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were being exploited by England? Well, the Founding Fathers took care of that in leading the struggle for independence. Was the nation morally blighted by the existence of 4 million black slaves? Abraham Lincoln solved that with the Emancipation Proclamation. Did we have a terrible economic crisis in the early 1930s? Franklin Roosevelt got us out of that one. Do we face enormous problems today? Well, the solution is to find the right president, to go to the polls and choose either the Republican or Democratic&amp;nbsp;candidate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how much attention is given in historical writing to military affairs&amp;mdash;to wars and battles&amp;mdash;and how many of our heroes are military heroes. And consider also how little attention is given to antiwar movements and to those who struggled against the idiocy of&amp;nbsp;war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of omitting, or downplaying, the importance of social movements of the people in our history&amp;#8230;a fundamental principle of democracy is undermined: the principle that it is the citizenry, rather than the government, that is the ultimate source of power and the locomotive that pulls the train of government in the direction of equality and justice. Such histories create a passive and subordinate citizenry. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think I could put it much better than that, but in related news, I completed the first round of election pollster training today. Come February 5, I shall be a clerk of the polls (for better or&amp;nbsp;worse).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="politics"></category><category term="history"></category><category term="elections"></category><category term="zinn"></category></entry></feed>
