I didn&amp;#8217;t realize that two-factor authentication had finally taken off. It&amp;#8217;s practically vital for your email account (you&amp;#8217;re asking for trouble without it), but in the past year or so, a bunch of other services have begun offering&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went on a little security binge, and found that I could turn on two-factor authentication&amp;nbsp;at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google/Gmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Schwab (they send you a fob for&amp;nbsp;free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paypal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Web&amp;nbsp;Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One note about Charles Schwab is that getting their fob is great, but it&amp;#8217;s hardly all you should do to secure your account. You should also set up what they call a &amp;#8220;verbal password&amp;#8221; that you have to provide whenever you call in. Without it, it&amp;#8217;s pretty easy to get into an account via their surprisingly weak phone&amp;nbsp;security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is a pretty good list so far. The companies are using a handful of different techniques for doing this, but they all seem pretty solid in the end. Google&amp;#8217;s, naturally, seems to be one of the most robust, but I&amp;#8217;m impressed there&amp;#8217;s so much&amp;nbsp;offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go set these&amp;nbsp;up! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="google"></category><category term="yahoo"></category><category term="dropbox"></category><category term="two-factor authentication"></category><category term="charles schwab"></category><category term="facebook"></category><category term="paypal"></category><category term="amazon"></category></entry><entry><title>Amazon Has mp3’s! I Wish I Could Download Them…</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/22/amazon-has-mp3s/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-22T19:04:40-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-01-22:posts/2008/01/22/amazon-has-mp3s/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It made some headlines, and is about to make more during superbowl. 
&lt;a href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9848258-7.html?tag=newsmap"&gt;Amazon 
has started selling mp3&amp;#8217;s from all four of the major record labels.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;#8217;s a 
pretty cool revelation, so I went ahead and checked it&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what? Linux users, you are screwed. In order to download albums from 
Amazon, you must &amp;#8220;Get the Amazon mp3 downloader&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;which is not available for 
Linux. Excuse me? Say what? I have downloaded literally hundreds upon hundreds 
of files from the Internet, and never have I needed a special tool other than 
Firefox. Why&amp;nbsp;now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, if you&amp;#8217;re going to do something great like this, do it whole hog. 
Don&amp;#8217;t make me install junkware. After all, I&amp;#8217;m &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to give you 
money,&amp;nbsp;right? &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Music"></category><category term="Copyright"></category><category term="Amazon"></category><category term="Rant"></category></entry></feed>
