&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a place your mother goes when everybody else is soundly sleeping.
Through the lights of beacon street and if you listen you can hear her weeping, she&amp;#8217;s weeping, 
Cause the gentlemen are calling and the snow is softly falling on her petticoats,
And she&amp;#8217;s standing in the harbor and she&amp;#8217;s waiting for the sailors in the jolly boat. See how they&amp;nbsp;approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With dirty hands and trousers torn they grapple &amp;#8216;til she&amp;#8217;s safe within 
their keeping.
A gag is placed between her lips to keep her sorry tongue from any speaking, or screaming.
And they row her out to packets where the sailor&amp;#8217;s sorry racket calls for maidenhead.
And she&amp;#8217;s scarce above the gunnels when her clothes fall to a bundle and she&amp;#8217;s laid in bed on the upper&amp;nbsp;deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so she goes from ship to ship, her ankles clasped her arms so rudely 
pinioned
&amp;#8216;till at last she&amp;#8217;s satisfied the lot of the marina&amp;#8217;s teeming minions, in their&amp;nbsp;opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they tell her not to say a thing to cousin, kindred, 
kith or kin or she&amp;#8217;ll end up dead.
And they throw her thirty dollars and return her to the harbor where she goes to bed.
And this is how you&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;fed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So be kind to your mother, though she may seem an awful bother, 
and the next time she tries to feed you collard greens, remember what she does when you&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
