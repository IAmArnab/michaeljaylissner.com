&lt;p&gt;I chose to flesh out the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeran_v._America_Online,_Inc."&gt;Zeran v. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article, and man was it a lot of work. You take for granted the amount of labor that goes into a Wikipedia article until you write one&amp;nbsp;yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case itself is pretty interesting, if I do say so myself. It&amp;#8217;s one of the main cases that granted immunity to websites from the postings of third parties. What happened was that somebody posted some inflammatory T-shirts on an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AOL&lt;/span&gt; bulletin board in 1995, and put down Kenneth Zeran&amp;#8217;s name and phone number. He got hundreds of phone calls threatening and berating him, and decided to sue &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AOL&lt;/span&gt; as a result for distributing defamatory&amp;nbsp;materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Zeran though, between the time that the materials were posted, and the time that he sued, Congress passed the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act"&gt;Communications Decency Act&lt;/a&gt;, which pretty much covers &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AOL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s back (and google&amp;#8217;s, and yahoo&amp;#8217;s, and youtube&amp;#8217;s, and pretty much everybody&amp;nbsp;else&amp;#8217;s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sucks to be Zeran, but in the words of &lt;a href="http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/02/cyber/cyberlaw/04law.html"&gt;one article on the subject&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8230;illustrates a hard fact of life: Sometimes there is no legal remedy for those who suffer&amp;nbsp;wrongs.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, after all this, Zeran&amp;#8217;s phone number is still on whitepages.com. I wonder if he&amp;nbsp;knows&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="cyberlaw"></category><category term="paper"></category><category term="Zeran"></category><category term="AOL"></category></entry></feed>
