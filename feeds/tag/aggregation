With enough time, I could figure out every bug that I&amp;#8217;ve filed, every comment I&amp;#8217;ve posted, every patch that I&amp;#8217;ve submitted (there aren&amp;#8217;t many), and every &lt;em&gt;contribution&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve made. But it would take me a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOT&lt;/span&gt; of effort, and after not too long, I&amp;#8217;d be knee deep in records and notes of where I had&amp;nbsp;been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people that contribute and work on such projects, knowing these kinds of things is valuable in forming an online reputation. This lets people know whether you are a helpful person, what you find interesting, and where your expertise may be. If you&amp;#8217;re looking for work in such a field, it&amp;#8217;s great to be able to point to a record of contribution, and say, &amp;#8220;Yes, I am interested in this field, and I have a track record to prove it.&amp;#8221; It creates competition amongst&amp;nbsp;contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since the current eco-system of online contribution is so diversified, it becomes very challenging to determine a person&amp;#8217;s online reputation. Some sites do admirable work building in algorithms to calculate the value of users, and this is good. But if you&amp;#8217;re a person that has been interested in many applications, or that has been working on open-source projects for a long time, it&amp;#8217;s more likely than not that such systems fall&amp;nbsp;short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we need is an aggregated, centralized system that uses public APIs to build global &amp;#8220;meta&amp;#8221;-reputations.&lt;/strong&gt; This is likely not that hard, since many of the more-common systems for tracking user contributions already have APIs and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feeds for so many things. I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s more complicated than simply plugging into an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, but creating such a system might not be that hard, and would create great value for the open-source&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="user contribution"></category><category term="reputational system"></category><category term="Project idea"></category><category term="open source"></category><category term="aggregation"></category></entry></feed>
