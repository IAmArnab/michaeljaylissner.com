but on our trip we&amp;#8217;re going to be bringing a phone, a camera, 
an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; player and two headlamps. The phone doubles as our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; and the 
headlamps might be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; rechargeable. Having spare energy to get us through 
longer sections is&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve completed &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/battery-research.xlsx"&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt;, investigating which are the best 
options. As I
was reviewing the many battery pack and solar charger solutions that are 
out there, I came to a few conclusions right off the&amp;nbsp;bat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The models with turbines, like the &lt;a href="http://www.shopetoncorp.com/detail/ETO+NBOTU2000+RED"&gt;Eton BoostTurbine2000&lt;/a&gt; are crap. I
  called Eton to ask them how many cranks it would take to charge a phone. The technical support guy&amp;#8217;s response: &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;d be at it all day. These are meant for emergency use only.&amp;#8221; So turbines are&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea of using a solar panel is great, but doing so will suck. I 
 looked far and wide for an ultralight solar panel, but they&amp;#8217;re all heavier than just getting a battery pack. The problem with solar panels is that they need to have their own battery packs, so you end up carrying the extra battery pack &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the panel itself. If you&amp;#8217;re out for really long trips, these are probably worth it, but for trips where you&amp;#8217;ll be in and out of towns, there are lighter&amp;nbsp;options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a million wannabe battery pack manufacturers, like Timetec, 
 Powergen, Rokit and Unu. They&amp;#8217;re strong on branding, but when you go to their 
 website &amp;mdash; if they have one &amp;mdash; you&amp;#8217;ll find more marketing but not
  much real innovation or information. For example, in my attached chart, 
  there are many blank spots and questions marks for these&amp;nbsp;brands. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for battery packs for backpackers means finding one that&amp;#8217;s light, 
durable and efficient. There are a few features you probably want in&amp;nbsp;particular: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want a battery pack that will charge your devices as quickly as they
  support. Many battery packs, particularly the small ones, 
  only provide 1 amp of output from a single &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; port. If you have a device
   that can handle more (like a tablet), it&amp;#8217;ll charge quite slowly. The 
   best ones have as much as 2.5A output, and will adapt to send the right 
   amount of power to your&amp;nbsp;device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want a battery pack that charges quickly when you plug it into the 
 wall. You don&amp;#8217;t want to get stuck in town overnight because of how slowly 
 your battery pack&amp;nbsp;charges. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want a battery pack that offers &amp;#8220;pass through charging&amp;#8221;. This allows
  you to plug the battery into the wall, and plug your device into the 
  battery &amp;#8212; simultaneously &amp;#8212; allowing you to charge both at the same time. Most battery packs don&amp;#8217;t offer&amp;nbsp;this. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, you want the most energy packed into the smallest, lightest&amp;nbsp;device. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at all these features, there are three standout energy packs, 
the &lt;a href="http://www.myinnergie.com/productdetail.php?productid=237&amp;amp;languageid=1"&gt;Innergie PocketCell Duo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.ianker.com/anker-astro-external-battery-backup-charger/product/79UN53V1-B8P56A"&gt;Anker Astro 5600&lt;/a&gt; and 
the &lt;a href="http://usa.just-mobile.com/all/gum-doubleplus.html"&gt;Just Mobile Gum++&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Anker Astro ($30) is the lightest of the bunch, but it also is complex,
charges slowly when plugged in, and has a complex body. It has a 
flashlight, for what that&amp;#8217;s worth, and, at 4.2 ounces, 
has an energy density of 1333 mAh/oz. It does not appear to have 
passthrough&amp;nbsp;functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Just Mobile Gum++ ($90) is a very simple, lightweight and durable 
option. At 4.6 ounces, it&amp;#8217;s still very light. It has a slightly lower 
energy density from the Astro (1304 mAh/oz), but boasts an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABS&lt;/span&gt; shell, 
the fastest charge rate when plugged in (2500 mA), and just generally looks
like a good, simple&amp;nbsp;option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally is the Innergie PocketCell Duo ($90). This is the most powerful of 
the bunch, at 6800 mAh, has the highest energy density at 1456 mAh/oz) and 
has two output ports (both at 2100 mA). Unfortunately, unlike the Gum++, 
it only chargest at 1500 mA, so it will take longer to&amp;nbsp;charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PocketCell and Gum++ are both very new products, 
and don&amp;#8217;t have many reviews. The Anker has been around awhile and has 
decent reviews, though some upset people that aren&amp;#8217;t happy with their&amp;nbsp;products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my recommendation: If you need a battery pack that can charge two 
devices at the same time, get the Innergie PocketCell Duo. If not, 
get the Just Mobile Gum++. If you want to do your own analysis, 
check out the attached spreadsheet and go&amp;nbsp;wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Since Innergie does not mention whether their device supports 
pass through, I&amp;#8217;ve contacted them via their contact form and via Twitter. 
After more than two months, they&amp;#8217;ve been entirely non-responsive. There is 
another person on their Twitter stream that is complaining (loudly) that 
they never responded to a broken device complaint that he had. I can&amp;#8217;t 
recommend Innergie despite their slick device, great marketing, 
etc. Something is going wrong with that&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="shopping"></category><category term="new zealand"></category><category term="batteries"></category><category term="backpacking"></category></entry></feed>
