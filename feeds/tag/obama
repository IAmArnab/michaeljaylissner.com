I had embarrassingly weak knowledge of politics, and didn&amp;#8217;t vote in the election despite some people getting rather annoyed with me about it. I argued at the time (and I stand by this), that people should only vote if they know enough to vote the right way. At the time, I felt like I didn&amp;#8217;t know&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to remember how things were back then. Bush was obviously an idiot, but at the same time, it wasn&amp;#8217;t obvious how much damage he would do (or that somehow he&amp;#8217;d last eight years). My first hint that he was terrible was his thinking on stem cells, which pretty indisputably slowed medicine research for about a decade. Once I heard about this issue, I knew I should have voted, and became fairly active reading the news and learning the&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, I can thank the Bush administration for being one of the most corrupt, damaging, and all-around God-awful regimes in American history. If it hadn&amp;#8217;t been so terrible, I might not have gotten so interested. I think this is true for many of my friends as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just spent some time looking at a few of &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing_room/executive_orders/"&gt;Obama&amp;#8217;s executive orders and memos&lt;/a&gt;, and of the few I read, it&amp;#8217;s pretty impressive. It&amp;#8217;s been less than a week, and suddenly I&amp;#8217;m having a lot more trouble being critical of the administration. If I&amp;#8217;m not supposed to rag on Bush anymore, in a way, what do I do? Do I praise Obama? That&amp;#8217;s not really my style. Maybe I should be critical of the Obama administration? But there&amp;#8217;s not a lot to be too critical of just&amp;nbsp;yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a bit confused, in a good way. Here&amp;#8217;s to hoping that Obama can keep it up, and to a new&amp;nbsp;regime.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="politics"></category><category term="Obama"></category><category term="change"></category></entry><entry><title>Guantanamo to Close, But They’re Just Moving the Prisoners</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/01/12/guantanamo-to-close-but-they-are-just-moving-the-prisoners/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-12T23:17:53-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-01-12:posts/2009/01/12/guantanamo-to-close-but-they-are-just-moving-the-prisoners/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was happy to read the news today that &lt;a href="http://www.iht
.com/articles/2009/01/13/america/13gitmo.php?page=1"&gt;Obama 
plans to close Guantanamo Bay prison camp&lt;/a&gt;. This is good news for 
America, and should be good news for the prisoners&amp;nbsp;there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read up on it though, I was saddened to hear that the prisoners are 
just being moved to other countries. This is rather frustrating because as Noam Chomsky puts it &amp;mdash; and I&amp;#8217;m paraphrasing &amp;mdash; there&amp;#8217;s only one reason to have off-site &lt;del&gt;torture&lt;/del&gt; prison camps: to go around American&amp;nbsp;law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really not sure what the point is in closing Guantanamo if it just means
 moving the prisoners elsewhere. Pretty stupid use of&amp;nbsp;resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a juicy quote from the&amp;nbsp;article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have conferred with transition officials said the incoming 
administration appeared to have rejected a proposal to seek a new law 
authorizing indefinite detention inside the United States. The Bush 
administration has insisted that such a measure is necessary to close the 
Guantanamo camp and bring some detainees to the United&amp;nbsp;States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we could bring the prisoners to a camp in the U.S., 
but that would mean we couldn&amp;#8217;t hold them in tiny cells indefinitely, 
and that American law would be necessary. Wow. Can&amp;#8217;t have that, can&amp;nbsp;we?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="torture"></category><category term="prison camp"></category><category term="Obama"></category><category term="Cuba"></category></entry></feed>
