This made me wonder if I could perhaps fix the problem, so I began playing with all those buttons on my&amp;nbsp;monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to improve things, but until I discovered the images on &lt;a href="http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn&amp;#8217;t get it quite dialed&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually a pretty surprising experience adjusting the monitor at that website. You essentially are shown an image, and asked to adjust one of your settings until the image looks right. It works like a charm, and if your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; is at all fuzzy, I highly recommend&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="computer"></category><category term="monitor"></category><category term="lcd"></category><category term="tuning"></category></entry><entry><title>Volunteering At Last!</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/13/volunteering-at-last/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-13T21:17:09-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-01-13:posts/2008/01/13/volunteering-at-last/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of years I&amp;#8217;ve kinda, sorta been hunting on and off for 
a place where I could volunteer some of my free time. I started at the 
nearby university, thinking that I might be able to convince some kind 
professor to teach me some things. When that failed, 
I tried searching google for nonprofits that looked interesting. Failing 
that, I went on a limb, and asked a professor of mine if he had any ideas 
(he did, but they fell&amp;nbsp;through). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after all this time, one fell in my lap.  Last week, 
I was looking for a place where I could donate my &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/10/23/new-computer-and-give-away-pile/"&gt;old computer 
hardware&lt;/a&gt;, and I discovered the &lt;a href="http://www.accrc.org/"&gt;Alameda County Computer Recycling 
Center&lt;/a&gt;. It looks pretty darned cool. I will spend my time putting 
together old computers into useful devices, and then installing Ubuntu or 
Suse. In exchange, they will give computers (for free) to needy&amp;nbsp;parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not helping the homeless, but it should be educational for me and, 
ultimately for them. Plus, it will help to keep e-waste out of&amp;nbsp;landfills.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Linux"></category><category term="Computer"></category><category term="Non-Profit"></category><category term="Recycling"></category></entry><entry><title>Eco-tip 4 - Hibernate vs. Suspend</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/12/07/eco-tip-4-hibernate-vs-suspend/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-07T18:22:49-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-12-07:posts/2007/12/07/eco-tip-4-hibernate-vs-suspend/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For some reason, this bit of knowledge just hasn&amp;#8217;t gotten out there to the masses. I guess it&amp;#8217;s a bit nerdy, but here goes. When computers are not in use, they can do two very different things. They can either suspend, or they can hibernate (or you can turn them off of course). When they suspend, they go into a power saving mode that stores the state of your computer in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;. When they are hibernating, the state of your computer is stored on the hard&amp;nbsp;drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important distinction because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; requires energy to store information (making it volatile memory), and your hard drive does not (making it non-volatile memory). Hence, any time your computer is in suspend mode, it is incurring a negative environmental impact, and any time it is hibernating, it is incurring no more impact than a lump of&amp;nbsp;silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. I won&amp;#8217;t get into how to deal with these in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt;+Linux, (because I can&amp;#8217;t get my laptop to do either), but &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/mobility/getstarted/hibernate.mspx"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; has some good information on how to do it in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XP&lt;/span&gt;. If you are a Mac owner, this decision has been made for you. Your computer will suspend and hibernate at the same time, and there is no easy way I know of to hibernate only. (They call this SafeSleep, and the idea is that if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; hasn&amp;#8217;t been reset by a loss of power, it will boot from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;. Otherwise, it will boot from the hard&amp;nbsp;drive.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that hibernation is a great alternative to leaving your computer on when you go home at the end of the day. It saves the state exactly how you left the computer, and saves the environment by not using energy through the&amp;nbsp;night.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="eco-tip"></category><category term="computer"></category></entry><entry><title>The New Computer and The Giveaway Pile</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/10/23/new-computer-and-give-away-pile/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-23T00:13:23-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-10-23:posts/2007/10/23/new-computer-and-give-away-pile/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back, I mentioned that I was having some trouble setting up the Zimbra Suite on my server. I finally got it to work, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t as reliable as I needed it to be. When I looked into the problem, it seemed I just needed a newer computer to run it. Apparently they were serious when they talked about the minimum hardware requirements (who&amp;nbsp;knew?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about just running a lighter-weight piece of software, but after I priced it out, I learned that I could get a new computer (sans monitor, keyboard, speakers, mouse and hard drives) for only $350. So I did. I just finished putting it together* and getting Zimbra working again (which was easy since I used the old hard drives), and now I&amp;#8217;ve got a give away&amp;nbsp;pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One computer, sans hard drive. It&amp;#8217;s a P3, it&amp;#8217;s got about a gig of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, graphics card, integrated ethernet. The case is a beaut, but it weighs in at about 20 lbs. If you get it a set of matched processors, it&amp;#8217;s actually kind of fast&amp;nbsp;- &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A P3 processor and heat&amp;nbsp;sink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDRAM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;spacers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working&amp;nbsp;keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Modems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s it. That computer could work well for somebody that does light computing. The rest is probably garbage, but you never know. Any&amp;nbsp;takers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The specs, in case somebody is interested, are meager, but still infinitely faster than the predecessor. The new computer is a Intel Duo, 2.13Ghz ($150), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2GB&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; ($70) and cheap motherboard with integrated video, sound and ethernet&amp;nbsp;($40).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="zimbra"></category><category term="computer"></category><category term="hardware"></category></entry></feed>
