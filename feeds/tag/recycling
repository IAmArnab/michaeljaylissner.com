a place where I could volunteer some of my free time. I started at the 
nearby university, thinking that I might be able to convince some kind 
professor to teach me some things. When that failed, 
I tried searching google for nonprofits that looked interesting. Failing 
that, I went on a limb, and asked a professor of mine if he had any ideas 
(he did, but they fell&amp;nbsp;through). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after all this time, one fell in my lap.  Last week, 
I was looking for a place where I could donate my &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/10/23/new-computer-and-give-away-pile/"&gt;old computer 
hardware&lt;/a&gt;, and I discovered the &lt;a href="http://www.accrc.org/"&gt;Alameda County Computer Recycling 
Center&lt;/a&gt;. It looks pretty darned cool. I will spend my time putting 
together old computers into useful devices, and then installing Ubuntu or 
Suse. In exchange, they will give computers (for free) to needy&amp;nbsp;parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not helping the homeless, but it should be educational for me and, 
ultimately for them. Plus, it will help to keep e-waste out of&amp;nbsp;landfills.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Linux"></category><category term="Computer"></category><category term="Non-Profit"></category><category term="Recycling"></category></entry></feed>
