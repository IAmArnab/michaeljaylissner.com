my class on the social and organizational issues of&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of my paper was a bit on the morbid side, but somehow that&amp;#8217;s what
 I&amp;#8217;m doing a lot of work on this semester. The concept for the paper is 
 that as more and more people create and have online profiles on social 
 networking sites, a system is created where more and more people have an 
 online memorial when they die, whether they intend to or&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic became interesting to me about a year ago when my friend Blake 
Bigler died of a sudden heart attack (at the age of 25). Immediately 
afterwards, his Facebook page became a memorial to him where friends posted
 messages, pictures and the like. To this day, friends still wish him a 
 happy birthday, and post notes on his&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that this was a dramatic change to the way that deaths occur and 
are memorialized, and that it needed to be analyzed more carefully, 
and so my paper was born. If you&amp;#8217;re interested, please feel free to&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="paper"></category><category term="thanatosensitivity"></category><category term="memorialization"></category></entry></feed>
