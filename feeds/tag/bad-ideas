grandparent&amp;#8217;s house. It&amp;#8217;s been a great trip, but one thing about it keeps 
plaguing&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a couple of days in New Orleans, and one of the places I insisted upon 
seeing was the 9th Ward, where Katrina dealt some of the worst damage. I wanted 
to see if people were recovering, and how much the place had been fixed up 
since 2005 when the storm blew&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprised me (aside from the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bisset_linda/3026355210/"&gt;markings&lt;/a&gt;) is that people are moving 
back into this area, rebuilding their houses, and generally, pouring money into 
the location. On the one hand, it makes sense since it&amp;#8217;s their home, but on the 
other, I can&amp;#8217;t help but think that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; should stop 
this from happening. From what I&amp;#8217;ve learned while here, the 9th Ward is an area 
of New Orleans that is going to flood if there is another hurricane 
Katrina&amp;#8230;which there will be sooner or later. Considering that Katrina 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina"&gt;killed almost 2,000 
people&lt;/a&gt; this seems rather&amp;nbsp;unwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, rather than moving back in, shouldn&amp;#8217;t we be cutting our losses right about 
now, finding somewhere for these people to live, and preventing another 
disaster? Or is my logic&amp;nbsp;flawed?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="policy"></category><category term="katrina"></category><category term="disaster"></category><category term="bad ideas"></category></entry></feed>
