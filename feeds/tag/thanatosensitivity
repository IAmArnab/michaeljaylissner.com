Today I completed the final paper 
for &lt;a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i205/s09/index.html"&gt;my class on information law and policy&lt;/a&gt;, which was one of my best 
classes this semester. It was a pretty tough one that required a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of 
reading and a lot of extra work for the assignments, but I found it quite 
rewarding in the&amp;nbsp;end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="{filenames}/pdfs/online-estates.pdf"&gt;attached assignment&lt;/a&gt; is in a similar vein to the one I posted on 
Tuesday, but approaches the topic from a slightly different angle. The assignment in 
this case was to present an analysis of some of the policy problems that are 
raised by a project of our choice. Since I had already done a lot of thinking 
about the policy implications of how we handle online assets after a death, I 
decided to analyze some of the problems that are raised, and to postulate some 
solutions of my&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thanatosensitivity"></category><category term="paper"></category></entry><entry><title>Final Paper on Online Memorialization by Default</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/05/13/final-paper-on-online-memorialization-by-default/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-05-13T11:25:10-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-05-13:posts/2009/05/13/final-paper-on-online-memorialization-by-default/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had an epic writing session, and finished &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/online-grieving.pdf"&gt;my final paper&lt;/a&gt; for
my class on the social and organizational issues of&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of my paper was a bit on the morbid side, but somehow that&amp;#8217;s what
 I&amp;#8217;m doing a lot of work on this semester. The concept for the paper is 
 that as more and more people create and have online profiles on social 
 networking sites, a system is created where more and more people have an 
 online memorial when they die, whether they intend to or&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic became interesting to me about a year ago when my friend Blake 
Bigler died of a sudden heart attack (at the age of 25). Immediately 
afterwards, his Facebook page became a memorial to him where friends posted
 messages, pictures and the like. To this day, friends still wish him a 
 happy birthday, and post notes on his&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that this was a dramatic change to the way that deaths occur and 
are memorialized, and that it needed to be analyzed more carefully, 
and so my paper was born. If you&amp;#8217;re interested, please feel free to&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="paper"></category><category term="thanatosensitivity"></category><category term="memorialization"></category></entry></feed>
