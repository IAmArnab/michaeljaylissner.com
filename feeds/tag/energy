entitled &lt;em&gt;Metrics of Sustainability&lt;/em&gt;. It was an interesting class all 
in all, though frustrating at times because of the emphasis on making 
sustainability something that businesses will &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to do. Our 
professor was a jocular fellow, though his history at large companies 
became evident in his notes on our final&amp;nbsp;paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/energy-metrics.pdf"&gt;The paper itself&lt;/a&gt; is designed to set up metrics for analyzing the social, 
financial, and environmental sustainability of a company in the energy 
sector. The project was at once overly simple and overly complicated. On 
the one hand, it was really quite tempting to just write metrics like, 
&amp;#8220;Did you damage the environment during the last year?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Did you lose 
money?&amp;#8221; On the other hand, writing complicated, and specific metrics was 
really the name of the game, and the hard part was finding the balance 
between the two. I was quite happy with the balance that we found, 
but our feedback was that our metrics were too complicated, 
and that there were too many of them. So it goes I&amp;nbsp;suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, for those interested, &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/energy-metrics.pdf"&gt;I have attached our metrics&lt;/a&gt; for the 
energy sector to this&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="sustainability"></category><category term="energy"></category><category term="paper"></category></entry></feed>
