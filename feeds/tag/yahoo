I didn&amp;#8217;t realize that two-factor authentication had finally taken off. It&amp;#8217;s practically vital for your email account (you&amp;#8217;re asking for trouble without it), but in the past year or so, a bunch of other services have begun offering&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went on a little security binge, and found that I could turn on two-factor authentication&amp;nbsp;at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google/Gmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Schwab (they send you a fob for&amp;nbsp;free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paypal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Web&amp;nbsp;Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One note about Charles Schwab is that getting their fob is great, but it&amp;#8217;s hardly all you should do to secure your account. You should also set up what they call a &amp;#8220;verbal password&amp;#8221; that you have to provide whenever you call in. Without it, it&amp;#8217;s pretty easy to get into an account via their surprisingly weak phone&amp;nbsp;security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is a pretty good list so far. The companies are using a handful of different techniques for doing this, but they all seem pretty solid in the end. Google&amp;#8217;s, naturally, seems to be one of the most robust, but I&amp;#8217;m impressed there&amp;#8217;s so much&amp;nbsp;offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go set these&amp;nbsp;up! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="google"></category><category term="yahoo"></category><category term="dropbox"></category><category term="two-factor authentication"></category><category term="charles schwab"></category><category term="facebook"></category><category term="paypal"></category><category term="amazon"></category></entry><entry><title>Yahoo! Drives Me Nuts</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/10/21/yahoo-drives-me-nuts/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-10-21T10:26:17-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-10-21:posts/2008/10/21/yahoo-drives-me-nuts/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I joined a yahoo group the other day, and I noticed that when Yahoo! shows my member information, it says I am three years younger than I am. &amp;#8220;No problem&amp;#8221; I thought to myself, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll just edit my information, surely I put in the wrong&amp;nbsp;birthday.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into the member section, and (after giving them my password for the second time in two minutes) found where my birthday was listed as &amp;#8220;on file.&amp;#8221; I clicked the edit button for that section, and in the resulting page, it again said that my birthday was &amp;#8220;on file.&amp;#8221; It did not give me a way to change&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering how to change it, I decided to try the help tool. I searched for &amp;#8220;change birthday,&amp;#8221; which gave me the response:&lt;blockquote&gt;Q: Why can&amp;#8217;t I change my birthdate, and why does it say, &amp;#8220;on file&amp;#8221;?
A: We use your birthdate as a security measure in case you forget your password. We would not be able to do so if you were able to change it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Great. Good work&amp;nbsp;guys.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="yahoo"></category><category term="bad security"></category></entry><entry><title>There’s a Lesson About Yahoo! Security I Learned from Palin Today</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/09/17/there-is-a-lesson-about-yahoo-security-i-learned-from-palin-today/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-09-17T15:08:09-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-09-17:posts/2008/09/17/there-is-a-lesson-about-yahoo-security-i-learned-from-palin-today/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The lesson is this: Yahoo! doesn&amp;#8217;t use encryption on their webmail. I&amp;#8217;ll 
repeat that: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAHOO&lt;/span&gt;! &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOESN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;T &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENCRYPTION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THEIR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WEBMAIL&lt;/span&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m nothing short of shocked. I could have sworn that Yahoo! was a $26B 
company. Surely, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SURELY&lt;/span&gt; they, of all people would see the importance and 
value of secure email, right?&amp;nbsp;Nope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;ve been offering free email since at least April of 1996 when they had 
their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt;. Somehow in the last 12 years they never secured the damned thing?&amp;nbsp;What?&lt;/p&gt;
