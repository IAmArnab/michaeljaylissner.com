At CourtListener, for example, we make URLs with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; numbers in them that are formed by converting an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; number to letters (so a &amp;rarr; 1, b &amp;rarr; 2, 27 &amp;rarr; A, etc). Higher numbers create longer strings of letters, so over time, this creates curse words in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;. Currently, the site is only has a few four letter strings, but I will rue the day when any of the &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Seven_dirty_words"&gt;seven dirty words&lt;/a&gt; is being shown to users on my&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many lists of curse words on the web, but none that is maintained or curated. Having that alone would be a useful project. What would make it better would be libraries in popular programming languages that efficiently told you if a string contained a curse&amp;nbsp;word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next feature would be to add additional languages, and then to add words like pen1s, which aren&amp;#8217;t normally curse words, but are certainly words you&amp;#8217;d want to&amp;nbsp;eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;d be a pretty simple project, so I may just go for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only question is, what do I name&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Project idea"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="cursing"></category></entry></feed>
