&lt;p&gt;As of now, I&amp;#8217;ve boiled my classes down to the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixing and Remixing&amp;nbsp;Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface&amp;nbsp;Aesthetics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social and Organizational Issues of&amp;nbsp;Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategic Computing and Communications&amp;nbsp;Technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Law and&amp;nbsp;Policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyberlaw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And somehow, I only had to buy three books and four readers this semester, for a total of $315. Somehow, this is more than last semester when I had five books and four readers. Oh well. The books from this semester&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network&amp;nbsp;Economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software and Internet&amp;nbsp;Law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro Web 2.0&amp;nbsp;Mashups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, classes are going well, but at least one of them will need to get cut. It&amp;#8217;s going to be hard to decide, but luckily I don&amp;#8217;t have to for another few&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="ischool"></category><category term="books"></category></entry><entry><title>Final Papers on Music Jukebox</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/01/07/jukebox-papers/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-07T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-01-07:posts/2009/01/07/jukebox-papers/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This semester for my &lt;a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i216/f08/"&gt;Computer-Mediated Communication&lt;/a&gt; class I had 
the opportunity to work with a couple of guys on a project aimed at solving
a problem that we have in our society. While perhaps not the greatest 
problem, the one we identified was how to choose music in a public location
that maximally pleases the maximum number of people, and further, 
how to encourage real-world interaction among and between those people. In
other words, how to choose good music, and how to get people to talk to 
each other rather than bury their nose in their&amp;nbsp;computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To long-term readers of this blog, this may sound familiar, 
as &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/02/public-jukebox-for-internet-cafes/"&gt;I proposed the idea of a democratic music jukebox a while ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the project went quite well. It was a great team, 
and we were able to write several papers explaining how such a system would
work, and what kinds of problems it would solve. We weren&amp;#8217;t able to really
make the system, however we were able to create a &lt;a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~ryan/i216/jukebox-prototype/jukebox2.php"&gt;wireframe mockup&lt;/a&gt; 
which should give you some idea of what we had in&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested in the idea, I&amp;#8217;ve attached our &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/cmc-final.pdf"&gt;final paper&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/cmc-poster.pdf"&gt;poster presentation&lt;/a&gt; to this blog entry. The poster itself is a bit cut up 
so it could be pasted together on poster board. Apologies for&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Computer-mediated Communication"></category><category term="ischool"></category><category term="music"></category><category term="paper"></category></entry><entry><title>Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/08/25/ch-ch-ch-ch-changes/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-25T21:02:04-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-08-25:posts/2008/08/25/ch-ch-ch-ch-changes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, we got back from Peru on Sunday (pictures forthcoming), and today was my 
last day at work with the &lt;a href="http://ehsd.org/comm000.html"&gt;Community 
Services Bureau&lt;/a&gt; of Contra Costa&amp;nbsp;County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve never worked somewhere for so long - all in all,  it was about three 
years, during which time I progressed from Temp Clerk to Intermediate Clerk 
to Assistant Manager. You do gotta love working in&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, I&amp;#8217;ve been planning on quitting since about December of 2006, when I 
first applied to go back to school. Now that it&amp;#8217;s a year and a half later, 
I&amp;#8217;m surprised I&amp;#8217;m not more excited or elated about this change. It&amp;#8217;s possible 
it hasn&amp;#8217;t sunk in yet because I have been on vacation for the past two weeks 
(and am used to not going to work), but ultimately, I feel pretty normal, 
which is&amp;nbsp;odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is the first day of school at the &lt;a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu"&gt;Berkeley 
School of Information&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve got my classes all set up, and I&amp;#8217;m shocked at 
exactly how awesome the classes&amp;nbsp;are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the official list as of&amp;nbsp;now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Organization and&amp;nbsp;Retrieval&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributing Computing Applications and&amp;nbsp;Infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Politics of&amp;nbsp;Piracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate Change Impacts and&amp;nbsp;Adaptation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer Mediated&amp;nbsp;Communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photovoltaic Materials: Modern&amp;nbsp;Technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metrics of&amp;nbsp;Sustainability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of classes, eh? It&amp;#8217;s 20 units as of now, so I am definitely going to drop a number of them. It&amp;#8217;s going to be hard to decide which to drop though. It&amp;#8217;s a three-way split between classes offered through Haas school of business, the Energy and Resources Group and the iSchool. I guess we&amp;#8217;ll see which float to the&amp;nbsp;top. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="ischool"></category></entry></feed>
