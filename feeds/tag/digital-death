handle and cope with real life death, and I found a good quote today. It&amp;#8217;s 
not exactly about the Internet and death, but it&amp;#8217;s interesting to think 
about ways the Interne  may have made relationships more complex and how 
that has affected who is socially allowed to&amp;nbsp;grieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=memorializing%20loved%20ones%20on%20the%20world%20wide%20web"&gt;Memorializing Loved Ones on the World Wide 
Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are unwritten but familiar rules, however, about who is entitled to
grieve. Pine, for example, claimed that in &amp;#8220;compartmentalized society, 
funerals tend to be limited primarily to the &amp;#8216;proper&amp;#8217; bereaved people. This
has helped to create an underclass of grievers whose legitimacy may not 
even be recognized and whose needs are not addressed.&amp;#8221; Doka (1989) 
identified these individuals as disenfranchised grievers: those whose grief
occurs in relationships with no recognizable kin ties; those whose loss is 
not socially defined as significant; and those who are perceived to be 
incapable of grief (e.g., young children, very old adults, 
mentally-disabled persons)&amp;#8230;As relationships become more complex, 
the likelihood of disenfranchised grief and disenfranchised death&amp;nbsp;increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As somebody who has lost a couple of friends over the years that I was 
fairly close to (but not best friends with), this definitely hits&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="digital death"></category><category term="online grief"></category><category term="mourning"></category></entry></feed>
