number. Today I received supplements in the mail for my prostate. Supplements 
that were bought with my credit card. For those wondering, no, I do not need 
this medicine. No, I did not order this&amp;nbsp;medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m intrigued and a bit amused that this is what my identity thief decided to 
do with my money, but I&amp;#8217;m going to have to decline their offer of prostate 
supplements. This purchase raises so many questions, I don&amp;#8217;t know exactly 
where to&amp;nbsp;begin.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="identity"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>I Am Me, Dammit!</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/09/15/i-am-me-dammit/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-09-15T15:00:30-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-09-15:posts/2008/09/15/i-am-me-dammit/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, it happened. The bastards stole my identity. They somehow got my credit 
card number, address, phone number, etc, took them, and put them to use. Grand 
total losses: $309. Not too bad,&amp;nbsp;considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve called my credit card company, and they promise to reimburse me for my 
losses. This is when I thank the federal government for making them do this. 
Thank you&amp;nbsp;feds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m thinking about how this happened, and I have a theory. I am about 95% sure 
this happened as a result of shopping for car parts online. One of the 
retailers I went to (lost to me now) decided to share my contact information 
with a number of &amp;#8220;partners&amp;#8221; so that a part I was looking for could be found 
more easily. I ended up getting the part, but I think they might have shared 
more info than they should have.&amp;nbsp;Arg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of the services that credit cards have tried to sell me over the 
years to protect me from this kind of thing, I&amp;#8217;m happy to say that I&amp;#8217;m fine 
without them. It&amp;#8217;s really not the end of the world&amp;#8230;it&amp;#8217;s annoying though,&amp;nbsp;yes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rant"></category><category term="theft"></category><category term="bastard"></category><category term="identity"></category><category term="security"></category></entry></feed>
