For those who don&amp;#8217;t know what these are, they&amp;#8217;re great. What they allow you to do is &amp;#8220;subscribe&amp;#8221; to web sites, so that if the site is updated, you know pretty much immediately. I have about 40 of these subscriptions, which are mostly to friends&amp;#8217; blogs, news sites, or some other sites I like to keep track of. It&amp;#8217;s really convenient: I don&amp;#8217;t have to monitor some 40 sites, I just check my feed reader, and it will do the legwork for me on all of the&amp;nbsp;sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I digress. One of the feeds I subscribe to is &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars"&gt;Ars Technica, Open Ended&lt;/a&gt;, which is supposed to be their journal of open source news. It&amp;#8217;s usually top notch news, but I have noticed that occasionally certain open source news items don&amp;#8217;t make it to into Open Ended. I mentioned this to them yesterday, and today they have created a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed for open source&amp;nbsp;news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about service. They&amp;#8217;re officially the bomb. The new feed is &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/oss.rssx"&gt;arstechnica.com/oss.rssx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out. Pretty slick, I must&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ars technica"></category><category term="open source"></category></entry></feed>
