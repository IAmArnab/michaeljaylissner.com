solutions. One problem I&amp;#8217;ve run into many times throughout the years is that
the feeds I have in Google Reader are largely dead, and there&amp;#8217;s no way to get
rid of the ones that are no longer updated or simply&amp;nbsp;gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/mlissner/trim-my-feeds/overview"&gt;So I built a&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out on BitBucket and give it a whirl. It&amp;#8217;ll go through an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPML&lt;/span&gt; file, 
check all the feeds in it, and make a new file for you that has them cleaned
out. In my case, it purged about 20% of the feeds I had &amp;#8212; a big&amp;nbsp;improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a simple tool, but look, if your friend hasn&amp;#8217;t updated their blog in 
two years&amp;#8230;they&amp;#8217;re probably not going to. If the feed is gone, you no longer 
need it cluttering your life. If a feed has been redirected, you should fix 
that in your reader! Little things,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="trim"></category><category term="opml"></category><category term="open source"></category><category term="google reader"></category><category term="exodus"></category></entry></feed>
