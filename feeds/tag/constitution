fourth amendment rights are being daily eroded by technology marching on. 
I didn&amp;#8217;t go too deeply into the importance of the fourth amendment (I 
probably should have), but if you&amp;#8217;re not up on your rights (or lack 
thereof), you might find this to be interesting&amp;nbsp;reading.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Technology Revolution"></category><category term="Fourth Amendment"></category><category term="Constitution"></category></entry></feed>
