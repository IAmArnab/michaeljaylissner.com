federal appeals courts. Last night I finally finished the last of them, 
so today I&amp;#8217;m moving on to the design of the site. Design is always much 
better when people work in a team, so I&amp;#8217;m putting these designs here so 
others can look at them and give me feedback. Please, please&amp;nbsp;do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;#8217;ve sketched out four of the major pages that the site will have. A
user&amp;#8217;s will begin using the site on its homepage. Here, 
they will be given few options. Basically, they can login, 
register for an account, make a search, or read one of the ancillary pages 
such as the &amp;#8220;About&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Privacy&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="/images/final-project/1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, note the advanced button under the search field. When this is 
clicked, it expands to show the advanced search queries that the site will 
support, as you can see on the next&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people are logged in, their homepage becomes the &amp;#8220;Create new alert page,
&amp;#8221; which you can see below. For now, this allows users to create very 
complicated queries by hand. In the future, it would be nice to build their 
queries for them. By default, the advanced section will be collapsed, 
but in the wire frame, I sketched it out. Also, if users click on &amp;#8220;More 
details,&amp;#8221; (in the bottom-right of the &amp;#8220;Advanced&amp;#8221; box) they can get 
explanations and examples of all the connectors&amp;nbsp;shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="/images/final-project/2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that page, they would normally be redirected to their settings page, 
where their alerts are listed. Here, they can edit and see their&amp;nbsp;alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="/images/final-project/4.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking the &amp;#8220;Edit&amp;#8221; button takes a user back to the &amp;#8220;create alert&amp;#8221; page, 
except that it will be pre-filled with the alert they&amp;#8217;re trying to&amp;nbsp;edit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, users can also edit their profile by clicking on the settings 
link on the top of every page . This page isn&amp;#8217;t too special, 
though it does have a couple unusual features, such as the bar memberships 
the user is a part of and whether they prefer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; or plain text emails (not
 shown in the below version -&amp;nbsp;sorry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="/images/final-project/3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s it for now. I&amp;#8217;d &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOVE&lt;/span&gt; any feedback anybody has on these. Typing 
this up, I&amp;#8217;ve already come across a couple&amp;nbsp;problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users currently get to their alerts by clicking settings - that ain&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;intuitive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The about page is pretty hard to find. It may need more&amp;nbsp;emphasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure there are more problems I&amp;#8217;m not seeing. That&amp;#8217;s why I need your help
. What am I missing? What should I change? What&amp;#8217;s stupid?

&lt;p&gt;In the first, &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/breaking-recaptcha.pdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking ReCAPTCHA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I discuss a few methods that 
ReCAPTCHAs can be hacked, and talk a bit about the ways that they were 
attacked by the Anonymous hacker group. I should mention at the outset that
none of the approaches here are particularly useful though, 
and that ultimately, the hacker group beat ReCAPTCHA by simply out 
numbering&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/proactive-security.pdf"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;second paper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a brief discussion of some approaches an 
organization might take when beginning a project in which security is a 
high concern. Essentially, it takes a chronological approach, 
from the start to the end of the&amp;nbsp;project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="security"></category><category term="captcha"></category><category term="ReCAPTCHA"></category><category term="Design"></category></entry></feed>
