&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#8217;s donations are larger than any previous year, but largely fall along similar trends as in the past. The larger donations this year (about $1,000-worth) go towards non-profit organizations. The choices this year were hard. After consulting with a few friends, I decided to donate to two new categories: Environmental and&amp;nbsp;Anti-Gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a good environmental organization to give your money is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HARD&lt;/span&gt;. After a few hours of research, I had looked at many organizations that were doing good work. But a lot of those organizations were still trying to prove the point that climate change is an issue, or were focused on small-scale issues. These are both noble goals, but I think what we need now are big solutions on an international level. I&amp;#8217;m no expert in this topic, by far, but I&amp;#8217;m fairly convinced that individual decision making isn&amp;#8217;t going to solve the problem fast enough. It&amp;#8217;s great if we all learn to recycle and to consider environmental impact in our daily lives. That, I don&amp;#8217;t disagree with. But I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s enough. I think we need to start forcing governments and organizations to be cleaner. I&amp;#8217;m convinced that so long as the economic incentives are in place that have led to the current behaviors, the market will follow those incentives. I&amp;#8217;m hopeful that my donation to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions will help bring changes to these&amp;nbsp;incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding an anti-gun organization is easier, especially given the current state of affairs after Sandyhook Elementary School. While I&amp;#8217;m not so sure that anti-gun legislation is going to solve any truly big problems, I hope that donating my money here will help strike while the iron is hot. I simply can&amp;#8217;t believe that the 2nd Amendment pro-gun lobby is as successful as it is, and I am hopeful that we&amp;#8217;ll be able to change the dialog around guns over the next few years. Gun ownership is trending down in the U.S., and I hope that we can accellerate that trend, bringing a cease to the needless gun deaths violence we currently live&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big donations in this year&amp;#8217;s list go mostly towards organizations that I&amp;#8217;ve donated to in the past. Fair Vote and Rootstrikers are organizations that work to fix the current political system. Most Americans (about 70%, I believe) agree that the current Federal legislation system is corrupt, and these organizations are working to fix that. I&amp;#8217;m pessimistic that until these organizations find success, we won&amp;#8217;t be able to deal with the small or large issues facing the country, so these organizations continue to get the plurality of my donation ($400 between them). I think the ridiculous fiscal cliff &amp;#8220;negotiations&amp;#8221; are testament to how bad things have gotten. Our political system is&amp;nbsp;paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other organizations that did well this year include a handful of open-source foundations that I rely on, but which otherwise give away their work for free. My livelihood and these very donations rely on these bits of infrastructure we take for granted, so I figure I should give them some money to keep &amp;#8216;em&amp;nbsp;going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the nitty gritty breakdown of my donations this year (as well as last):

&lt;p&gt;As always, I welcome input on these decisions, and suggestions for the years ahead. Those that made suggestions for this year, I truly appreciate your&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="voting reform"></category><category term="technology"></category><category term="me"></category><category term="donations"></category><category term="charity"></category><category term="campaign finance"></category><category term="alma mater"></category></entry></feed>
