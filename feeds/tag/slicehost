At this point, it&amp;#8217;s safe to say that the results of the experiment are in. While running my own server out of my attic has been an enlightening experience, teaching me about everything from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;, ultimately, I have come to the conclusion that if I want a reliable, powerful and secure sever, running it myself is not the way to do&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that light, today I&amp;#8217;ve transferred this website over to the people at &lt;a href="http://slicehost.com"&gt;slicehost&lt;/a&gt;. This will give me (almost) all the freedom of running the server myself, and should relieve some of the headaches I&amp;#8217;ve had for the past couple of years when it came to power outages, comcast and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;T outages, and the&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving the site over has been a bit complicated, so if you see anything weird, 
let me know via the &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/contact"&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; link, which should work as of&amp;nbsp;now. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="slicehost"></category><category term="drupal"></category></entry></feed>
