I didn&amp;#8217;t realize that two-factor authentication had finally taken off. It&amp;#8217;s practically vital for your email account (you&amp;#8217;re asking for trouble without it), but in the past year or so, a bunch of other services have begun offering&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went on a little security binge, and found that I could turn on two-factor authentication&amp;nbsp;at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google/Gmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Schwab (they send you a fob for&amp;nbsp;free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paypal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Web&amp;nbsp;Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One note about Charles Schwab is that getting their fob is great, but it&amp;#8217;s hardly all you should do to secure your account. You should also set up what they call a &amp;#8220;verbal password&amp;#8221; that you have to provide whenever you call in. Without it, it&amp;#8217;s pretty easy to get into an account via their surprisingly weak phone&amp;nbsp;security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is a pretty good list so far. The companies are using a handful of different techniques for doing this, but they all seem pretty solid in the end. Google&amp;#8217;s, naturally, seems to be one of the most robust, but I&amp;#8217;m impressed there&amp;#8217;s so much&amp;nbsp;offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go set these&amp;nbsp;up! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="google"></category><category term="yahoo"></category><category term="dropbox"></category><category term="two-factor authentication"></category><category term="charles schwab"></category><category term="facebook"></category><category term="paypal"></category><category term="amazon"></category></entry><entry><title>Analyzing Facebook’s Security Mechanisms</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/11/15/analyzing-facebooks-security-mechanisms/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-11-15T17:43:55-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-11-15:posts/2009/11/15/analyzing-facebooks-security-mechanisms/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my &lt;a href="http://is219.blogspot.com/"&gt;Privacy, 
Security and Cryptography&lt;/a&gt; class, we studied a set of 13 principles for 
secure&amp;nbsp;systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security is&amp;nbsp;Economics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Least&amp;nbsp;Privilege&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Fail-Safe&amp;nbsp;Defaults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separation of&amp;nbsp;Responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defense in&amp;nbsp;Depth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychological&amp;nbsp;Acceptability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure Complete&amp;nbsp;Mediation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Least Common&amp;nbsp;Mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect if You Cannot&amp;nbsp;Prevent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orthogonal&amp;nbsp;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Rely on Security Through&amp;nbsp;Obscurity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design Security in, From the&amp;nbsp;Start&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our midterm, we were asked to analyze how Facebook exemplifies or does not 
follow these principles. It was an interesting assignment, which finally 
forced me to think more thoroughly about Facebook&amp;#8217;s security policies, and I&amp;#8217;m
happy to &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/pdfs/facebook-security.pdf"&gt;attach my findings&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some people these may be rather run of the mill notes. For others, you may 
be surprised at poor security of the world&amp;#8217;s biggest photo and social 
networking&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="updates"&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014-08-22&lt;/strong&gt;: While updating this blog to a new platform, 
I wound down these tests and put notes about each service’s final result. 
After nearly five years, some of these sites still haven’t taken down the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010-03-08&lt;/strong&gt;: Added an image at drop.io&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010-01-28&lt;/strong&gt;: Added an image at Orkut.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010-01-28&lt;/strong&gt;: At &lt;a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/privacyroundtables/index.shtml"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTC&lt;/span&gt; privacy round table&lt;/a&gt; today, 
Facebook’s director of public policy, Tim Sparapani, claimed that information 
deleted from Facebook cannot be retrieved even by Facebook staff, 
because it is almost instantly deleted. I informed him this was not true in
the case of pictures, and he said he would look into it. Will update this 
post when/if I hear more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="background-and-threat-model"&gt;Background and Threat Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine an embarrassing photo of you is placed online by one of your 
friends. You ask them to take it down, and they do. Now, 
imagine that your enemy had gotten a link to that photo, 
and had posted it to their blog. You’d hope that your friend taking the 
photo down would in fact delete the photo, but I’m sorry to say that isn’t 
always the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/07/are-those-photos-really-deleted-from-facebook-think-twice.ars"&gt;Jacqui Cheng’s article&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to test some of the 
more popular online services for photo hosting to see what happens when you
press the delete button on a photo from their site. On &lt;strong&gt;November 
14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2009&lt;/strong&gt;, I uploaded and then deleted the following image of
a black box with white text to Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, MySpace, Photobucket, 
Shutterfly, Twitpic and WalMart. A few months later, 
I also added drop.io and Orkut: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="I will attempt to delete this photo" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/photo-deletion-tests/PostedAndDeleted.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look below, if you can see the black box for a site, 
that means that it was not truly deleted and is still live. You can verify 
this by clicking on the image. This is checked each time this page is 
loaded, so the information is constantly verified. If the image has been 
deleted, you will see the date that it was deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons why photo services might be lazy about 
properly removing images from their site, but until they have proper 
deletion mechanisms, we should all think twice about what we upload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s a service that is not shown here that you’d like to see, 
please &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/contact"&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;. And now, without further ado, 
I present, the ongoing results of the test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook properly deleted the photo from their server as of May 27, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="flickr"&gt;Flickr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flickr began showing the following message approximately an hour after the 
image was deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flickr Response" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/photo-deletion-tests/flickr-response.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="picasa"&gt;Picasa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picasa properly deleted the photo from their server as of at least November
15, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="myspace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an unknown time, MySpace began showing this photo instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MySpace Response" src="https://michaeljaylissner.com/images/photo-deletion-tests/myspace.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="photobucket"&gt;Photobucket&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photobucket properly deleted the photo from their server as of at least 
November 14, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="shutterfly"&gt;Shutterfly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2014-08-22, Shutterfly still shows &lt;a href="http://im1.shutterfly.com/media/47b9cf35b3127ccef8c9be9d18a800000040O00ActW7Ro4cuWQPbz4W/cC/f%3D0/ps%3D50/r%3D0/rx%3D720/ry%3D480/"&gt;the original image on their 
server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="twitpic"&gt;Twitpic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitpic properly deleted the photo from their server as of at least 
November 14, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="walmart"&gt;Walmart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2014-08-22, Walmart still shows &lt;a href="http://images.photos1.walmart.com/232323232%7Ffp432%3B4%3Enu%3D3%3A%3A2%3E%3A8%3A%3E238%3EWSNRCG%3D326634885%3B329nu0mrj"&gt;the original image on their

&lt;h2 id="google-orkut-added-2010-01-28"&gt;Google Orkut (added 2010-01-28)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2014/06/30/google-shutting-orkut-social-network-september-30/"&gt;nearly shut down completely&lt;/a&gt;, as of 2014-08-22, 
Orkut still shows &lt;a href="http://images.orkut.com/orkut/photos/NwAAAA40TqrVmtf2vIA1oouDdb9vUTcjWDAQqVo_mBa45mvjdqMPiHhSaHxekFNT596b5sVYh593XRK-5Nquk0_WOQMAm1T1UJmPN1ZDUab24PgUE8b4ZMm09Mjj.jpg"&gt;the original image on their server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dropio-added-08-march-2010"&gt;Drop.io (added 08 March 2010)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drop.io properly deleted the photo from their server as of 8 March 2010,

One of the best methods explained in the article is to cordon off your friends into different groups of people, and to then set different permissions for those groups. Thus, the common technique is to put your ex-partners into one group, your friends into another, family into another, and thus down the&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  in practice this technique is nigh on impossible. I have family members (such as cousins) that are close friends, and so-called friends that, really, I haven&amp;#8217;t talked to since high school. Beyond this, managing the groups is a problem too since over time, some of your friends become closer and others more&amp;nbsp;distant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking through this problem, I have come up with a better, and perhaps more obvious solution: Simply organize your Facebook friends into groups based on how much you want those people to know about you. In practice I found this to be fairly simple with only three groups: Loose Privacy, Standard Privacy, and Strict Privacy. Bosses, ex-partners and distant friends go into the Strict category, close friends and current partners go into the Loose category, and everybody else goes into the Medium&amp;nbsp;category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this dumbs down the power that Facebook gives you to categorize your friends into groups, but in practice, it&amp;#8217;s much easier to maintain, since there are only three lists, and it&amp;#8217;s clear who belongs in&amp;nbsp;which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second group of  settings that people are likely unaware of are those that &amp;#8220;limit what types of information your friends can see about you through applications.&amp;#8221; These are important and creepy because by default, when your friends install an application, that application can see and aggregate an incredible quantity of information about you, even without your or your friend&amp;#8217;s permission or knowledge. As part of its &lt;a href="http://dotrights.org"&gt;dotrights campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACLU&lt;/span&gt; is currently working on an application that demonstrates this loophole, but for the moment, it&amp;#8217;s probably wise to adjust these&amp;nbsp;settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To adjust these settings so third-party applications can see as little information as possible (without your friends simply not using them), go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Applications, and then click on the &amp;#8220;Other&amp;#8221; tab (&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=platform&amp;tab=other"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; should also work, if you&amp;#8217;re logged in). Once on that page, uncheck all of the boxes in the first section, and save your&amp;nbsp;settings.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="facebook"></category><category term="privacy"></category><category term="configuration"></category></entry><entry><title>Twitter (and Facebook) Integrated</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/01/25/twitter-and-facebook-integrated/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-25T13:03:03-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-01-25:posts/2009/01/25/twitter-and-facebook-integrated/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I upgraded the site a bit today by adding my Twitter/Facebook feed to left-hand sidebar.
