The professor for this class is the same as the one that taught the Cyberlaw class I took in the Spring, and once again, he has asked us to work on Wikipedia as part of our&amp;nbsp;classwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to choose an article on Wikipedia that was related to the class, and I chose to work on the article on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobsen_v._Katzer"&gt;Jacobsen v. Katzer&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very important case as it relates to open source licensing, patent law, copyright, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DMCA&lt;/span&gt;, and just about every other possible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; law&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it was a very complicated case because Katzer has attempted to throw the book at Jacobsen (and vice versa). The court has not yet resolved all the issues, but from reading through about half of the court documents that &lt;a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/k/docket/index.shtml"&gt;Jacobsen has posted&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that Katzer&amp;nbsp;has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patented technology that was not his to&amp;nbsp;patent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempted to get licensing fees from Jacobsen for those&amp;nbsp;patents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stolen the intellectual property of an open source project, stripped it of its license and then incorporated it into his own commercial&amp;nbsp;project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempted to sue Jacobsen for copyright violation for something - I&amp;#8217;m not even sure&amp;nbsp;what&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And more - see the article for&amp;nbsp;details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it&amp;#8217;s a nasty, nasty case, but ultimately it should work out for Jacobsen, and he should come out the better (or at least none the worse). At a minimum, he has to prove that the patents are invalid, Katzer stole his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, and that he didn&amp;#8217;t steal Katzer&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; - a walk in the&amp;nbsp;park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, that&amp;#8217;s easier said than done, but he&amp;#8217;s fighting what appears to be the good fight, and it looks like if he keeps at it, he will win in the&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="patent"></category><category term="paper"></category><category term="open source"></category><category term="Jacobsen v.

I mean really. We can see how hot things are using infrared cameras. We can put infrared cameras in microwaves. Why must we always type in a length of time that we want things to cook for, when really, all we want is to press a button labeled &amp;#8220;Make my food&amp;nbsp;hot.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I finally looked into this idea today. It&amp;#8217;s been &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=MLYlAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=5693247"&gt;patented by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LG&lt;/span&gt; since 1997&lt;/a&gt;. So, there goes that&amp;nbsp;idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish they would make one. Imagine a microwave where you dial the power level, then press go. When the food is hot, it stops. Ah, the future&amp;#8230;err&amp;#8230;the 1997 patent that never went anywhere. Maybe we can free this patent because it&amp;#8217;s not &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness"&gt;non-obvious&lt;/a&gt; anymore.&amp;nbsp;Doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="patent"></category><category term="microwave oven"></category></entry></feed>
