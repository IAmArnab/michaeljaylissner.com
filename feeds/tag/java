&lt;p&gt;Over the past several weeks/months, I have been slaving away over my 
computer writing this program. When used, it will generate a dynamic 
graphing area that will load up temperature data for one to six &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;hikers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those that are interested in the most complicated programming 
assignment I have ever worked on &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/pct-temperatures"&gt;are welcome to check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am officially a free man once again! Thanks to all who made this possible
with their encouragement and&amp;nbsp;patience! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pct"></category><category term="java"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="project"></category></entry><entry><title>The Great Temperature DataÂ Project</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/11/01/great-temperature-data-project/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-11-01T20:40:55-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-11-01:posts/2007/11/01/great-temperature-data-project/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in &amp;#8216;05 when I hiked from Mexico to Canada on the Pacific Crest Trail, I 
carried a little device called an &lt;a href="http://www.iButton.com"&gt;iButton&lt;/a&gt;. 
This little device contains essentially three things: a clock, a bit of memory 
and a thermometer. It&amp;#8217;s waterproof, accurate to 0.1 degree Celsius, and is about 
the size of five dimes stacked one upon another. There are a bunch of silly 
things you can do with these, but what I chose to do with mine was to have it 
record the temperature every hour on the hour for the entire time I was hiking, 
with the idea being to get some good data about the temperature out there on 
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCT&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, you can figure that the temperature was recorded 24 times a day 
for about 150 days, for an astounding 3600 data points, and about 150 
oscillations from the daytime high to the nighttime low. I&amp;#8217;ve spent some time 
working with the data, and it&amp;#8217;s pretty much impossible to make much use of&amp;#8230;.unless 
you write a program to interpret it. You can 
&lt;a href="http://charityhikers.org/pct/temps.htm"&gt;see it for 
yourself&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as fate should have it, I am currently enrolled in a Java programming 
class, and I have the option of doing a final project of my own choosing. 
Having not put this data to good use has been a burden on my soul for a 
couple of years now, and I&amp;#8217;ve decided to make my final project an applet that 
will allow a user to plot this data on a graph for any date range and any time 
range that they choose (e.g. 5pm to 10pm for September 20th to&amp;nbsp;23rd).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, I will attempt to post it here, but here&amp;#8217;s the question to 
you dear reader, do you have any suggestions as to features that you would be 
interested in seeing in an applet of this sort?&amp;nbsp;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m quite excited about getting this info out there.&amp;nbsp;Finally.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pct"></category><category term="java"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="project"></category></entry></feed>
