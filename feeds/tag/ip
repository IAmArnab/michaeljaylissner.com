I thought I would do a little experiment to see how much I would be in for if my entire collection were to be found to be&amp;nbsp;illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s do some math. I have 3,876 tracks, at $150,000 each. So if my entire collection were to be found illegal, that means it would cost me $581.4 million dollars &amp;mdash; about .6 billion&amp;nbsp;dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, let&amp;#8217;s assume that I can live with that reality. It just seems odd that I could have bought those songs for $3,876 on amazon.com, or&amp;nbsp;iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something isn&amp;#8217;t quite right here. Also, did I mention that all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; digital music sales &lt;a href="http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_resources/dmr2008.html"&gt;are estimated&lt;/a&gt; to total $2.9B in 2007? That makes my music worth about 20% of the 2007&amp;nbsp;revenue.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Music"></category><category term="Copyright"></category><category term="IP"></category><category term="Policy"></category><category term="Law"></category></entry><entry><title>Mr. Rogers on the Usage of VCRs</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/11/22/mr-rogers-on-the-usage-of-vcrs/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-11-22T17:13:23-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-11-22:posts/2008/11/22/mr-rogers-on-the-usage-of-vcrs/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found a good quote by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Rogers"&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/a&gt; himself today. I knew I always liked this guy. Too bad he couldn&amp;#8217;t live forever. This quote is a bit dated, but the point is still good. It also helps to imagine his voice before reading this:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the &amp;#8220;Neighborhood&amp;#8221; at hours when some children cannot use it. I think that it&amp;#8217;s a real service to families to be able to record such programs and show them at appropriate times. I have always felt that with the advent of all this new technology that allows people to tape the &amp;#8220;Neighborhood&amp;#8221; off-the-air, and I&amp;#8217;m speaking for the &amp;#8220;Neighborhood&amp;#8221; because that&amp;#8217;s what I produce, that they then become much more active in the programming of their family&amp;#8217;s television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been &amp;#8220;You are an important person just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions.&amp;#8221; Maybe I&amp;#8217;m going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is important.&lt;/blockquote&gt;You tell them Mr. Rogers. You tell&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;em.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="copyright"></category><category term="VCR"></category><category term="IP"></category></entry></feed>
