This weeks&amp;#8217; big news is that a number of memos authorizing, rationalizing and generally condoning torture and interrogation &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&amp;ncl=1334762857&amp;topic=h"&gt;have been released to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACLU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a couple of interesting facts here.  The first is that &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; few of the 3,000 or so news articles about this topic seem to link to the &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/olc_memos.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACLU&lt;/span&gt; site where the memos are prominently featured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I find this odd, and it gives me plenty of room for speculation. (Bad reporting? Laziness? Suppression? Something&amp;nbsp;else?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second interesting thing is the quotes in the memos themselves. I haven&amp;#8217;t had a chance to read all the memos yet, but I didn&amp;#8217;t have any difficulty finding some good stuff. The memos begin with a classic &amp;#8220;Top Secret&amp;#8221; stamp, and go on to say things such as:&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#8230;You would like to employ ten techniques&amp;#8230;These ten techniques are: (1) attention grasp, (2) Walling, (3) facial hold, (4) facial slap (insult slap), (5) cramped confinement, (6) wall standing, (7) stress positions, (8) sleep deprivation, (9) insects placed in a confinement box, and (10) the waterboard&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From a different memo:&lt;blockquote&gt;Detainees subject to sleep deprivation who are also subject to nudity as a separate interrogation technique will at times be nude and wearing a diaper. If the detainee is wearing a diaper, it is checked regularly and changed as necessary&amp;#8230;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They go on from there with great detail about how the interrogations go down, with the conclusion of course being that these things don&amp;#8217;t constitute&amp;nbsp;torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The math was done crudely. &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&amp;ncl=1334762857&amp;topic=h"&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; a google search that turns up 2,890 hits on the topic, and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;num=20&amp;q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.aclu.org%2Fsafefree%2Fgeneral%2Folc_memos.html+interrogation+memo&amp;btnG=Search"&gt;here&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; one that searches for sites that link to aclu.org, and that have the words &amp;#8220;interrogation memo&amp;#8221;. The method is crude, but the overlap is&amp;nbsp;sparse.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="news"></category><category term="torture"></category><category term="cia"></category><category term="interrogation"></category><category term="ACLU"></category></entry><entry><title>Guantanamo to Close, But They’re Just Moving the Prisoners</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/01/12/guantanamo-to-close-but-they-are-just-moving-the-prisoners/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-12T23:17:53-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-01-12:posts/2009/01/12/guantanamo-to-close-but-they-are-just-moving-the-prisoners/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was happy to read the news today that &lt;a href="http://www.iht
.com/articles/2009/01/13/america/13gitmo.php?page=1"&gt;Obama 
plans to close Guantanamo Bay prison camp&lt;/a&gt;. This is good news for 
America, and should be good news for the prisoners&amp;nbsp;there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read up on it though, I was saddened to hear that the prisoners are 
just being moved to other countries. This is rather frustrating because as Noam Chomsky puts it &amp;mdash; and I&amp;#8217;m paraphrasing &amp;mdash; there&amp;#8217;s only one reason to have off-site &lt;del&gt;torture&lt;/del&gt; prison camps: to go around American&amp;nbsp;law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really not sure what the point is in closing Guantanamo if it just means
 moving the prisoners elsewhere. Pretty stupid use of&amp;nbsp;resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a juicy quote from the&amp;nbsp;article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have conferred with transition officials said the incoming 
administration appeared to have rejected a proposal to seek a new law 
authorizing indefinite detention inside the United States. The Bush 
administration has insisted that such a measure is necessary to close the 
Guantanamo camp and bring some detainees to the United&amp;nbsp;States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we could bring the prisoners to a camp in the U.S., 
but that would mean we couldn&amp;#8217;t hold them in tiny cells indefinitely, 
and that American law would be necessary. Wow. Can&amp;#8217;t have that, can&amp;nbsp;we?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="torture"></category><category term="prison camp"></category><category term="Obama"></category><category term="Cuba"></category></entry></feed>
