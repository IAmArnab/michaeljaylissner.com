protect people&amp;#8217;s privacy, and today we completed one more privacy&amp;nbsp;enhancement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my last post on this topic, we discovered that although we had 
already blocked cases from appearing in the search results of all major 
search engines, we had a privacy leak in the form of our computer-readable 
sitemaps. These sitemaps contain links to every page within a website, 
and since those links contain the names of the parties in a case, 
it&amp;#8217;s possible that a Google search for the party name could turn up results
that should be&amp;nbsp;hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was problematic, and as of now we have changed the way we serve 
sitemaps so that they use the &lt;code&gt;noindex X-Robots-Tag&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; header. This tells 
search crawlers that they are welcome to read our sitemaps, 
but that they should avoid serving them or indexing&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="sitemaps.xml"></category><category term="privacy"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="CourtListener"></category></entry></feed>
