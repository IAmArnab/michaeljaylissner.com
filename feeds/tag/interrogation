This weeks&amp;#8217; big news is that a number of memos authorizing, rationalizing and generally condoning torture and interrogation &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&amp;ncl=1334762857&amp;topic=h"&gt;have been released to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACLU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a couple of interesting facts here.  The first is that &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; few of the 3,000 or so news articles about this topic seem to link to the &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/olc_memos.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACLU&lt;/span&gt; site where the memos are prominently featured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I find this odd, and it gives me plenty of room for speculation. (Bad reporting? Laziness? Suppression? Something&amp;nbsp;else?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second interesting thing is the quotes in the memos themselves. I haven&amp;#8217;t had a chance to read all the memos yet, but I didn&amp;#8217;t have any difficulty finding some good stuff. The memos begin with a classic &amp;#8220;Top Secret&amp;#8221; stamp, and go on to say things such as:&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#8230;You would like to employ ten techniques&amp;#8230;These ten techniques are: (1) attention grasp, (2) Walling, (3) facial hold, (4) facial slap (insult slap), (5) cramped confinement, (6) wall standing, (7) stress positions, (8) sleep deprivation, (9) insects placed in a confinement box, and (10) the waterboard&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From a different memo:&lt;blockquote&gt;Detainees subject to sleep deprivation who are also subject to nudity as a separate interrogation technique will at times be nude and wearing a diaper. If the detainee is wearing a diaper, it is checked regularly and changed as necessary&amp;#8230;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They go on from there with great detail about how the interrogations go down, with the conclusion of course being that these things don&amp;#8217;t constitute&amp;nbsp;torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The math was done crudely. &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&amp;ncl=1334762857&amp;topic=h"&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; a google search that turns up 2,890 hits on the topic, and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;num=20&amp;q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.aclu.org%2Fsafefree%2Fgeneral%2Folc_memos.html+interrogation+memo&amp;btnG=Search"&gt;here&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; one that searches for sites that link to aclu.org, and that have the words &amp;#8220;interrogation memo&amp;#8221;. The method is crude, but the overlap is&amp;nbsp;sparse.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="news"></category><category term="torture"></category><category term="cia"></category><category term="interrogation"></category><category term="ACLU"></category></entry></feed>
