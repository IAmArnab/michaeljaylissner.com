I had embarrassingly weak knowledge of politics, and didn&amp;#8217;t vote in the election despite some people getting rather annoyed with me about it. I argued at the time (and I stand by this), that people should only vote if they know enough to vote the right way. At the time, I felt like I didn&amp;#8217;t know&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to remember how things were back then. Bush was obviously an idiot, but at the same time, it wasn&amp;#8217;t obvious how much damage he would do (or that somehow he&amp;#8217;d last eight years). My first hint that he was terrible was his thinking on stem cells, which pretty indisputably slowed medicine research for about a decade. Once I heard about this issue, I knew I should have voted, and became fairly active reading the news and learning the&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, I can thank the Bush administration for being one of the most corrupt, damaging, and all-around God-awful regimes in American history. If it hadn&amp;#8217;t been so terrible, I might not have gotten so interested. I think this is true for many of my friends as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just spent some time looking at a few of &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing_room/executive_orders/"&gt;Obama&amp;#8217;s executive orders and memos&lt;/a&gt;, and of the few I read, it&amp;#8217;s pretty impressive. It&amp;#8217;s been less than a week, and suddenly I&amp;#8217;m having a lot more trouble being critical of the administration. If I&amp;#8217;m not supposed to rag on Bush anymore, in a way, what do I do? Do I praise Obama? That&amp;#8217;s not really my style. Maybe I should be critical of the Obama administration? But there&amp;#8217;s not a lot to be too critical of just&amp;nbsp;yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a bit confused, in a good way. Here&amp;#8217;s to hoping that Obama can keep it up, and to a new&amp;nbsp;regime.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="politics"></category><category term="Obama"></category><category term="change"></category></entry></feed>
