I finally got it to work, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t as reliable as I needed it to be. When I looked into the problem, it seemed I just needed a newer computer to run it. Apparently they were serious when they talked about the minimum hardware requirements (who&amp;nbsp;knew?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about just running a lighter-weight piece of software, but after I priced it out, I learned that I could get a new computer (sans monitor, keyboard, speakers, mouse and hard drives) for only $350. So I did. I just finished putting it together* and getting Zimbra working again (which was easy since I used the old hard drives), and now I&amp;#8217;ve got a give away&amp;nbsp;pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One computer, sans hard drive. It&amp;#8217;s a P3, it&amp;#8217;s got about a gig of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, graphics card, integrated ethernet. The case is a beaut, but it weighs in at about 20 lbs. If you get it a set of matched processors, it&amp;#8217;s actually kind of fast&amp;nbsp;- &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A P3 processor and heat&amp;nbsp;sink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDRAM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;spacers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working&amp;nbsp;keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Modems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s it. That computer could work well for somebody that does light computing. The rest is probably garbage, but you never know. Any&amp;nbsp;takers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The specs, in case somebody is interested, are meager, but still infinitely faster than the predecessor. The new computer is a Intel Duo, 2.13Ghz ($150), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2GB&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; ($70) and cheap motherboard with integrated video, sound and ethernet&amp;nbsp;($40).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="zimbra"></category><category term="computer"></category><category term="hardware"></category></entry><entry><title>A Boring Confession</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/09/29/boring-confession/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-29T16:34:53-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-09-29:posts/2007/09/29/boring-confession/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I need a heatsink for the mail server.

Worth the Wait? Yes.</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/09/29/zimbra-done/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-29T16:20:59-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-09-29:posts/2007/09/29/zimbra-done/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally got Zimbra to work on Tuesday, and I must say it is one of the more frustrating things I have ever had to install. This isn&amp;#8217;t Zimbra&amp;#8217;s fault though - My rudimentary knowledge of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; makes mail serving rather challenging. My main two difficulties when installing Zimbra stemmed from 1) not opening &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; the ports on my router that I needed to, and 2) assorted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; difficulties mentioned&amp;nbsp;above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that it is working reliably though, I&amp;#8217;m quite pleased with it, and I&amp;#8217;ve realized that it&amp;#8217;s so excellent that I am going to have to move all my mail accounts over to it very soon. It has a couple of rather pleasing functions that I&amp;#8217;m excited about. The first is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt;, which allows me to have the same contact list no matter how or where I get my&amp;nbsp;mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, and probably more important feature is Transport Layer Security (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLS&lt;/span&gt;) which creates a level of encryption between me and my server so that if an email gets as far as my server without getting eavesdropped upon, it can go that last bit of the journey from the server to me without any worries. This is a feature that for some reason I never had before now, and I&amp;#8217;m quite glad to have it, just in&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it&amp;#8217;s nice to finally have webmail that&amp;#8217;s good enough that I have to think to myself about whether or not I want to check my mail in Thunderbird or Firefox. What a&amp;nbsp;concept. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="zimbra"></category></entry><entry><title>Chronicals of installing Zimbra, OR If it looks awesome, it’s probably a pain to install.</title><link href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2007/09/14/zimbra-chronicals/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-14T00:24:56-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2007-09-14:posts/2007/09/14/zimbra-chronicals/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;a href="http://www.redhatxchange.com/Zimbra.html"&gt;check this out&lt;/a&gt;. Use the username &amp;#8216;admin&amp;#8217; and the 
password &amp;#8216;zcsadmin&amp;#8217;. When you&amp;#8217;re done there, come back here, 
and pick up where you left&amp;nbsp;off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s pretty sweet right? Calendar functions, ajaxy goodness, tagging, 
searching, etc. Pretty much all you could want from a web email client, 
right? Right. So I figured I&amp;#8217;d download and install it. The first thing that
 worried me was that it wasn&amp;#8217;t in the repositories of Ubuntu software, 
 so it wasn&amp;#8217;t just a &lt;code&gt;sudo aptitude install zimbra&lt;/code&gt; away. So I 
 downloaded it to &lt;code&gt;/usr/src&lt;/code&gt;, unpacked it, found the install script 
 (&lt;code&gt;install.sh&lt;/code&gt;), and began the magic (&lt;code&gt;cd /usr/src/zsc; sudo ./install
 .sh&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; overheated about 20 times while downloading 
the Zimbra Suite (apparently it needed thermal grease and a heat sink 
realignment), all went well until the install script got to resolving my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MX&lt;/span&gt; 
records, hostname, /etc/hosts file, etc. Apparently figuring these out is a 
bloody pain in the ass (forgive the imagery, I mean it in the British sense)
. So for the past few days I&amp;#8217;ve been struggling with getting this figured 
out, and the point of this post is, if you&amp;#8217;ve been sending emails to any 
@michaeljaylissner.com address, I&amp;#8217;m ashamed to say, 
they&amp;#8217;re not going through. But you probably have realized this, 
because they&amp;#8217;re bouncing back to you. Well, now you know&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me a couple more days, I&amp;#8217;m working on it. In the mean time, 
the &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/contact"&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; link does&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Linux"></category><category term="zimbra"></category></entry></feed>
