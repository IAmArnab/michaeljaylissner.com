He may not have freed the slaves or 
created the nation, but it is safe to say that his every action and his 
every belief furthered the dream and the ideals of the American state. After
 eight years of Bush policies dragging down the nation, 
 and a year of Obama sounding increasing like an echo of Bush, 
 it is truly tragic that we are losing this&amp;nbsp;thinker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/01/19/howard-zinn-the-use-and-abuse-of-history/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; this quote from Zinn&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Passionate Declarations&lt;/em&gt; 
some time ago, but now more than ever it seems&amp;nbsp;relevant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sorts of values and ideals are encouraged in the young people of the
 coming generation by the enormous emphasis on the Founding Fathers and the 
 presidents? It seems to me that the result is the creation of dependency on
  powerful political figures to solve our&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how much attention is given in historical writing to military 
affairs&amp;ndash;to wars and battles&amp;ndash;and how many of our heroes are military 
heroes. And consider also how little attention is given to antiwar movements and to those who struggled against the idiocy of&amp;nbsp;war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of omitting, or downplaying, the importance of social movements
 of the people in our history&amp;#8230;a fundamental principle of democracy is 
 undermined: the principle that it is the citizenry, 
 rather than the government, that is the ultimate source of power and the 
 locomotive that pulls the train of government in the direction of equality 
 and justice. Such histories create a passive and subordinate&amp;nbsp;citizenry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
